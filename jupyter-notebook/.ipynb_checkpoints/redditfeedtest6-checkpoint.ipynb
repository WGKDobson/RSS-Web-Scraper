      "2DES Meet in the Middle: <!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I need Python code that can find keys (k1 and k2) for a meet in the middle attack. I have an encrypted PNG file. Therefore, I know the ciphertext and a part of the plaintext, since I can get the PNG signature. So, I can match the 8 byte PNG signature (plaintext) with the first 8 bytes of the encrypted PNG file. Does anyone have code that can find the keys used to encrypt the png file?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Crallsas\"> /u/Crallsas </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/jb7dk0/2des_meet_in_the_middle/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/jb7dk0/2des_meet_in_the_middle/\">[comments]</a></span> \n",
