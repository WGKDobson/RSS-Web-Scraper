      "[TEXT] Pontiac, Michigan (CNN) President Donald Trump was running late when he arrived here Sunday morning, wind howling and tiny drops of ice sticking to his face, to begin the second-to-last day of his final run for office .\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's a little tough out here!\" he shouted over the gusts, wrestling with his black umbrella as it caught the wind before abandoning it and climbing into his limo.\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed it is.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even as polls tighten in battlegrounds across the country , Trump is still entering the last days of a caustic campaign with only a narrow path to victory -- albeit one he and his campaign remain convinced will manifest and one he is prepared to trumpet on election night even before all the votes are counted.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a breakneck sprint, with 17 rallies scheduled for the campaign's final four days , Trump is allowing himself little time to contemplate what he might do if he loses. Given how vague his stated goals for a second term have been, even the consequences of winning seem far from mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead, Trump these days is focused almost exclusively on the immediate task at hand: avoiding the shameful fate of becoming a one-term president by throwing himself headlong into his final campaign.\n",
      "\n",
      "He does not like to sit by himself in his cabin aboard Air Force One, contemplating his future. Instead, Trump takes his place behind his wooden desk with a Diet Coke as aides sit with him to discuss the campaign, watch as pundits talk about him on television and debate whether he should respond.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump demands continuous updates on the state of the race. On-board printers hum with fresh data to present the President. Last week, he scrawled \"MUST SEE TV!\" on an article about an upcoming Fox News interview and had it distributed to reporters at the back of the airplane.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's really a contest to see whether or not we can all stand it, right?\" Trump said at his frostbit event in Michigan, describing the icy weather but also finding an apt description of the beleaguered national sentiment as a bitter and lengthy campaign concludes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We love it! And I'm loving it,\" proclaimed Trump, though he hardly sounded convinced, complaining about the angle of his stage, the wind \"pouring up the nose\" and wondering which \"genius\" had planned his event.\n",
      "\n",
      "Increasingly, Trump's efforts on the trail amount to willing into existence the reality he'd rather be facing than the one he actually is. For him, coronavirus is a media exaggeration designed to prevent his campaign from hosting massive crowds. He insists the numbers for his rallies are bigger than ever, despite the pandemic. Even in states where some polls show him trailing, Trump is not quick to acknowledge a shortfall.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I shouldn't even be here. They said I have Georgia made,\" Trump said later Sunday, standing beneath two fluttering American flags in a state that's voted Republican in the last six presidential elections . \"But I said, I promised -- we have to be here. They said, 'Sir, you don't have to come to Georgia. It's won.' \"\n",
      "\n",
      "'How the hell can we be tied?'\n",
      "\n",
      "Not one for introspection, but deeply prone to insecurity about potential failure, Trump has offered only fleeting glimpses of turmoil about potentially falling short.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How the hell can we be tied?\" Trump has asked about states where he and Biden are running neck-to-neck, viewing his rival as an unworthy and mortifying opponent to lose to.\n",
      "\n",
      "He has joked he might drive an 18-wheeler into the distance, escaping the political life he chose for himself five years ago. And he has mused about fleeing overseas to escape humiliation -- or, in the sneers of his critics, to avoid prosecution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aides insist those asides are sarcastic and aren't reflective of a preoccupation with losing. In a serious way, Trump has not divulged to many what he might do should he lose. The delicate matter is not discussed widely among his team and has not been raised often with the President, who believes adamantly he will win.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking to victory past November 3 also amounts to bad luck in Trump's mind, those around him say. While he has suggested mass firings in his Cabinet should he win , he has not made his intentions explicitly known -- though by his final, muggy rally on a Miami area tarmac on Sunday night, he seemed ready to offer a hint.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't tell anybody, but let me wait until a little bit after the election. I appreciate the advice,\" Trump said just after midnight in response to a \"fire Fauci\" chant that had broken out in the crowd.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even the straightforward question of what would comprise his second term agenda has gone mostly unanswered -- partly, one official said, because Trump doesn't want to jinx his chances of winning.\n",
      "\n",
      "If Trump does fail to win a second term -- the first president to do so in almost 30 years -- few believe he would fade into the background like his predecessors, who mostly stepped away from public life. Trump will almost certainly continue tweeting. Some on his team speculate he would even continue holding rallies just for the sake of it -- or as a potential money-making venture.\n",
      "\n",
      "After all, it is the rally where Trump has seemed most himself, even after four years of being president and ample time to adjust to a more presidential way of behaving. In the final month of the campaign, they are essentially all he has done aside from being hospitalized with coronavirus. On Sunday, Trump likened himself to Pavarotti, the Italian tenor who he claimed would refuse to sing in the cold.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't have that,\" Trump insisted. \"I'm not a diva.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Ten hours and three rallies later, Trump boasted he could draw bigger crowds than his rivals, who have enlisted musical acts in the final stretch but are intentionally limiting their events because of rampant coronavirus.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do this without a guitar!\" he exclaimed underneath a full moon in Georgia.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, at stops where the crowds fall short of his expectation, Trump does make less of an effort. He sounded dour and spoke for only about 20 minutes on Friday in Minnesota when rally was limited by the state's coronavirus restrictions.\n",
      "\n",
      "And Trump is not shy about dressing down advisers after events he deems subpar.\n",
      "\n",
      "As his plane lands at small regional airports across the upper Midwest, Pennsylvania and the Southeast, Trump sometimes looks out the window as he taxis past the crowds awaiting his address and asks aides for a headcount. Because of the pandemic, they are smaller now than they were in 2016, a fact Trump has refused to admit even as it remains patently obvious to any casual observer. Often, aides throw out numbers with little rooting in reality.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The crowds are bigger. Everything's hotter,\" Trump told a crowd in Hickory, North Carolina, on Sunday after buzzing the crowd in his Marine One helicopter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Familiar choreography\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump has repeated a near-identical choreography everywhere he goes. As Lee Greenwood's \"God Bless the USA\" begins blasting from speakers beneath Air Force One, Trump emerges at the top of the steps and slowly descends. He makes his way to stage as the song culminates, delivers what has become a mostly surprise-free but riddled-with-falsehoods speech, ends by declaring he will still \"make America great again,\" and departs to the thumping gay pride anthem \"YMCA.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "While his younger aides buoyantly form the letters with their arms during the song's refrain, Trump performs his own moves: hands clenched into fists, elbows akimbo, the rhythm his own.\n",
      "\n",
      "Differences between the rallies can be hard to discern. Sometimes he adds a new insult of his rivals; this weekend's addition was claiming his Democratic rival Joe Biden's signature aviator sunglasses were too small for his face and that his running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, has been mispronouncing her own name.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regional distinctions hardly matter; Trump delves into Minnesota's politics in Michigan and Pennsylvania's politics in Iowa. Often it is the weather that provides the clue; even in mild cold Trump prefers to wear a long black overcoat and black leather gloves.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recently, as aides struggled to get Trump to recite the salient political points they hope will galvanize voters, video screens have appeared where Trump plays mini campaign ads that make those points for him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He does not often leave the tarmac. When he does, like on a trip to a small race track in West Salem, Wisconsin, last week, he doesn't like to venture far. On route to the venue, which snaked past a Sam's Club and a snow-dusted cow field, campaign aides ensured a billboard was visible along the route blaring the words \"TRUMP COUNTRY.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He has not gone in for retail politics, partly because any unscheduled appearance at a restaurant or takeaway would place him squarely in the optics of coronavirus. When he stopped for pizzas in Pennsylvania in August, he seemed somewhat taken aback by the plexiglass barriers between himself and the cashier. Trump rarely, if ever, encounters voters who do not support him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Life on the road\n",
      "\n",
      "A lover of routine, Trump has spent only a handful of nights away from the White House, preferring to fly back even from late-night rallies. When he spent the night at Mar-a-Lago for the first time since March before voting early in West Palm Beach, Trump made only the briefest of appearances at the breakfast buffet, popping his head through a door to say hello as guests poured themselves orange juice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not that he has been sleeping much at home. On Thursday, after returning to the White House in the dark after a two-day Western swing, Trump was tweeting at 3 a.m. about the prospect of an election decided by the Supreme Court.\n",
      "\n",
      "It isn't clear how much of his wife or teenage son he has seen lately; first lady Melania Trump has recently embarked for the first time on the campaign trail herself. All three had coronavirus last month; Trump has taken to touting his 14-year-old son Barron's infection as evidence of the mild effect on young people, suggesting he had it for either two minutes, 14 minutes or 15 minutes. His wife's diagnosis has also proved useful: \"At least those rumors that we don't live together proved to be false,\" he said Saturday in Pennsylvania.\n",
      "\n",
      "Along the way he has found some new interlocutors, including the rapper Lil Wayne, who had been in touch with the White House about Trump's plan for bolstering Black communities and was invited to meet the President at his Doral golf club in South Florida last week. Recounting the meeting at the White House the following day, Trump referred to his new supporter as \"Little Wayne.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But he has mostly opted for the familiar. While not particularly wistful, Trump does sometimes wax nostalgic about his only previous campaign. He has assembled many of the same aides, most decades his junior, to accompany him as he attempts to repeat his victory this year. He will hold his final campaign rally on Monday evening in Grand Rapids, Michigan, the same place he held his final event in 2016.\n",
      "\n",
      "He claimed to confuse two of his longtime advisers -- Hope Hicks and Sarah Sanders -- during a sunny rally in Iowa on Sunday.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My bad!\" he called out from the stage.\n",
      "\n",
      "He has even said he misses his black-and-gold Boeing 757, whose white leather interior was where much of his 2016 campaign played out.\n",
      "\n",
      "No room for introspection\n",
      "\n",
      "The President has often lamented that his political efforts since then have felt comparatively staid, people who have spoken to him said, weighed down by the massive apparatus that accompanies any president and saddled with an incumbent's responsibilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "He hasn't appeared as mawkish about the potential \"lasts\" he is experiencing now. There was little to mark the moment when he traveled to Nashville in October for what would be his final presidential debate. In the draped-off holding room where Trump reviewed talking points from a red folder, his team had arranged for a display of blown-up photos of his rallies to boost his mood.\n",
      "\n",
      "The pace of this autumn's news cycle would have made self-reflection difficult even for the most introspective candidate, which Trump is decidedly not. A surprise Supreme Court vacancy, an outbreak of coronavirus at the White House and his own infection and subsequent hospitalization have made an already consequential election feel generational in importance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump's campaign determined long ago that undecided voters were a rarity in this contest and have focused their efforts instead on ensuring Trump supporters actually cast ballots. That is part of their rationale for scheduling Trump's final campaign blitz.\n",
      "\n",
      "And while the push continues on Monday with a frenzied final day of stops in North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, there is little expectation the essential dynamics of the race will change before voting ends on Tuesday night.\n",
      "\n",
      "What happens afterward remains anyone's guess, including at the White House and among Trump's political advisers. A massive legal infrastructure is in place in both campaigns to contend with challenges and recounts. Trump himself has offered little assurance he will encourage calm should the results not appear in his favor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As soon as that election's over, we're going in with our lawyers,\" Trump said in North Carolina on Sunday, stopping between his second and third rallies of the day to speak with reporters as the sun set behind him.\n",
      "\n",
      "After inviting supporters to enter a chance to win tickets to an election night party at his hotel in downtown Washington, Trump scrapped a planned appearance there. He was put off, he said, by Mayor Murial Bowser's restrictions on large gatherings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead, he is expected to watch election returns from the White House, where he will also receive constant updates from his political team. Guests have been invited for an event in the East Room, but the precise outlines of the election night plans weren't yet clear.\n",
      "\n",
      "Television networks and other news outlets have already cautioned their audiences that its unlikely they will be able to declare a winner on Tuesday night, given the preponderance of early and mail-in ballots whose tallying will take more time.\n",
      "\n",
      "How Trump reacts to the information coming to him about percentages of early votes and turnout numbers is anyone's guess. But no officials have ruled out Trump declaring himself the winner even in the absence of formal vote counts or media projections.\n",

      "(CNN) In the eight months since the Covid-19 pandemic exploded across the United States, more than 9 million Americans have been infected and more than 230,000 have died, according to Johns Hopkins University. Yet President Donald Trump still doesn't have a science-based plan to bring the virus under control.\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed, the President has sidelined scientists and experts in favor of relying on his latest adviser and member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, Dr. Scott Atlas. Atlas, a radiologist who is neither an infectious disease expert nor an epidemiologist, has reportedly made supportive comments about a controversial \"herd immunity\" approach, which would let the virus run its course while somehow isolating the elderly and those who are most at risk. (Atlas has recently denied these reports.)\n",
      "\n",
      "The World Health Organization called the herd immunity proposal \"unethical\" and never used \"in the history of public health.\" It's also scientifically incoherent . We don't yet know if people who have recovered from the virus develop permanent immunity, as with chicken pox, or only temporary protection. Some patients develop long-term complications that may affect their health for months — or years — to come. And not only do we have plenty of evidence that young and healthy people can get very ill and die of Covid-19, we also know that there is no way to isolate the most vulnerable, since infections among young adults can easily spread to senior citizens.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the US climbs toward its third peak of infections, make no mistake: If Donald Trump is reelected, he'll continue to dismiss and downplay the pandemic. And with a \"herd immunity\" approach, as it's been reported the White House has discussed, more than 200 million Americans could get sick and more than 2 million could die\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, without targeted policy changes, we can expect Covid-19 to continue to have a disproportionate impact on people of color. Black Americans, Latinos, and Native Americans continue to be about 5 times more likely to be hospitalized than whites. Estimates indicate that a staggering 78% of American children who have died in the pandemic have been children of color. All told, about 1 in every 920 Black Americans has died of Covid-19 so far this year, according to a data analysis by APM Research Lab.\n",
      "\n",
      "All of which forces us to ask: If this virus wasn't disproportionately affecting people of color, would the White House handle this the same way it has so far? If 1 in 1,000 White Americans had died of Covid-19, would the White House be sitting on unspent money allocated by Congress that could be used to make testing free and widely available?\n",
      "\n",
      "The clear answer is no — because the Trump Administration's position has been consistent from their first day in office. President Trump, his advisers, and his Republican allies in Congress have sought every opportunity to penalize, punish, and persecute the most vulnerable among us, and especially vulnerable people of color, across every dimension of their policy agenda. In other words, having no Covid-19 plan is the President's plan — because of who is dying.\n",
      "\n",
      "Forget compassionate conservatism. Today's Republican Party is the party of caveman conservatism. Consider food aid. Having been blocked repeatedly from cutting food stamps by Democrats in Congress, the Trump Department of Agriculture is pursuing regulatory changes that would end Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits for more than 3 million people, and reduce benefits for 7 million more. If not for a recent federal judicial ruling, 700,000 unemployed Americans would have lost food assistance during the pandemic and a historic recession.\n",
      "\n",
      "And not only has President Trump held Covid-19 super spreader events — including at the White House itself — his administration is fighting in court right now to get rid of the Affordable Care Act in its entirety. If they win, the millions of Americans who have preexisting conditions — including those who recover from Covid-19 — could be denied coverage or be forced to pay higher rates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Almost the entire Republican Party is in lockstep with the President's vision. We weren't even a month into the pandemic when the Republican lieutenant governor of Texas said that older Americans might be willing to die to protect the economy. In 2017, Republican Rep. Roger Marshall said that low-income Americans are \"a group of people that just don't want health care and aren't going to take care of themselves.\" He later said he didn't mean to suggest poor people take their health care for granted.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the President's son-in-law Jared Kushner — also a senior White House adviser — insinuated in an interview on Fox News last Monday that Black people don't \"want to be successful.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Taken all together, the Republican Party's approach to every issue begins to look a lot like social Darwinism. In the circular logic of that discredited social theory, there is no such thing as being a victim of circumstance or systemic injustice. If you are deserving, you will manage to claw your way to the top of the heap. If you are not already at the top, you are a de facto loser who doesn't deserve the government's help. It's everyone for themselves.\n",

      "\n",
      "That approach might work in an Ayn Rand novel, but it doesn't work in the real world. The pandemic has made that plain. Unmasked college students can get grandparents sick. A wedding with 62 guests can trigger a statewide spread of the virus. And despite crowing that Covid-19 meant he would no longer have to shake hands with his supporters — who former Trump White House official Olivia Troye said he called disgusting people \" — the President, the first lady, and dozens of staff and prominent Republicans still got infected.\n",
      "\n",
      "More than eight decades ago, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt said, \"The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little.\" Donald Trump and the Republican Party have failed that test time and time again. It's up to the American people to set a new course — before it's too late for millions of us.\n",

      "[TEXT] AMERICA’S ECONOMY These 10 charts show how the economy performed under Trump versus prior presidents President Donald Trump inherited a strong economy, and it continued to grow at a healthy rate during his first three years in office. Then the Covid-19 pandemic changed everything.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the start of Donald Trump’s presidency in January 2017, the economy was healthy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Employers had added jobs for 76 months straight — the longest hiring streak on record at the time — and unemployment was just 4.7%, a 10-year low. Corporate profits were near all-time highs, and so were stocks. Overall, gross domestic product was growing around 2.5% a year — a modest rate for the world’s largest economy. Not everything was rosy: the federal debt was at its highest level since the 1950s. But by most metrics, it was hard to deny: the economy was on solid footing. And fortunately for Trump, the growth continued from there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then came the pandemic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Below, we’ve tracked 10 indicators to show how the economy evolved under each president from Ronald Reagan to Trump. Keep in mind, each presidency started under different circumstances. George W. Bush’s first year in office was plagued by the dot-com bust and the September 11th attacks. Barack Obama’s started with the Great Recession, following a devastating housing crash and a global financial crisis. Despite these crises, however, most recent presidents have presided over a growing economy during their time in office. The Trump presidency will be characterized by the country’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic, which is still playing out both as a health crisis and an economic one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hover over the charts to see how the economy under Trump compares with how it evolved under his predecessors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jobs Big losses\n",
      "\n",
      "Up until 2020, President Trump’s first term was characterized by solid job growth, but then the pandemic wiped out about 15% of American jobs in just two months. Since May, the economy has recovered only about half those jobs, and Trump is heading into the election with the worst job losses on record under any president.\n",
      "\n",
      "In contrast, at this point in Obama’s presidency, the job market was up 0.4%. He took office at a time when employers were cutting hundreds of thousands of jobs a month. Hiring kicked into higher gear later in his presidency.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unemployment A big rise\n",
      "\n",
      "By the time Trump entered office, he had inherited one of the strongest job markets in American history from Obama. But Covid-19 swiftly put an end to that. The unemployment rate shot to 14.7%, up 10 percentage points from when Trump took office. Although it has improved slightly since then, unemployment still remained elevated in September. No other president has encountered such a sudden spike in joblessness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Median income Big gains (Data until 2019)\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump loves to talk about how middle class incomes have increased during his presidency — and that was true in his first three years. In September, the Census Bureau released data showing that the median American household earned $68,703 in 2019 — up $5,800 or 9% from 2016, after adjusting for inflation. A strong job market helped lift incomes, as more people worked full-time, year-round. And more than 20 states also raised their minimum wage, boosting earnings for low-income workers.\n",
      "\n",
      "We don’t have data for 2020 yet, but the pandemic will surely impact those numbers in a big way. For some families, $1,200 stimulus checks and a temporary $600 boost in weekly unemployment benefits actually lifted incomes during the pandemic. But many others, especially those who have lost businesses or are grappling with long-term joblessness, are struggling to make ends meet.\n",
      "\n",
      "S&P 500 Big gains\n",
      "\n",
      "The longest bull market in history began shortly after Obama entered office and continued well into Trump’s presidency. Investors welcomed Trump’s corporate tax cuts in 2017, and although the trade war with China put them on edge, stocks enjoyed a record-breaking run all the way up to 2020. At the start of the pandemic in 2020, the S&P 500 plunged 34% in about a month, before recovering later in the summer. As of October 28, the index was up 44% in Trump’s presidency, overall. While that quick bounce-back is a bright spot for him, it also contrasts with 75% stock gains under Obama and 63% gains under Clinton at the same point in their presidencies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Home prices Big gains\n",
      "\n",
      "The housing market is one of the few parts of the economy that hasn’t dramatically declined during the pandemic. That’s in part because record-low interest rates and the work-from-home trend have led city dwellers to buy homes in suburban and rural areas, boosting home prices in many regions. It’s also because extensive measures, including a moratorium on evictions and forbearance programs for mortgages, have helped struggling families weather the crisis so far. Those unpaid bills could eventually catch up to millions of families, causing distress in the housing market. But so far, home prices are up 21% since Trump’s inauguration.\n",
      "\n",
      "Food prices Small increases\n",
      "\n",
      "If it feels like your grocery bill is higher lately, that’s because food prices did surge suddenly during the pandemic. Over the longer haul, however, they’ve been relatively stable. At this same point in the presidencies of Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Clinton and George W. Bush, food prices were already up 9% or more. They’re up only 6.1% under Trump, and were up 5.9% under Obama, reflecting an era of low inflation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consumer spending Up, but underperforming\n",
      "\n",
      "American consumers are the backbone of the US economy and are not easily fazed. Although consumers sharply cut back on spending at the start of the pandemic, they were quick to reopen their wallets in May and June once stimulus checks and unemployment benefits came to their aid. Retail spending on goods, particularly through online retailers, rebounded swiftly. (Meanwhile, spending on services like haircuts, travel and dining out at restaurants remains well below pre-Covid-19 norms.) Even with a quick recovery, though, consumer spending has grown less under Trump than under any of the prior five presidents.\n",
      "\n",
      "Manufacturing jobs Barely changed\n",
      "\n",
      "American manufacturing jobs peaked in 1979, and no president other than Clinton has presided over gains in factory jobs since then. So when Trump promised to bring back factory jobs, it was a tall order. In Trump’s first three years, the manufacturing sector did add some jobs, but in 2020, the pandemic ruined what little progress those workers had enjoyed. As of September, the sector was down 164,000 jobs, or 1.3% from when Trump took office. That said, layoffs at factories were even steeper under Presidents Reagan, Obama and the Bushes, as globalization and technological progress reduced America’s manufacturing workforce.\n",
      "\n",
      "Debt-to-GDP A big rise\n",
      "\n",
      "The federal government’s debt burden hasn’t been this high relative to the size of the economy since World War II, but it didn’t get there during Trump’s presidency alone. The debt grew under Reagan, who ushered in massive tax cuts, and it surged under Obama, who used federal stimulus funds to aid the economy during the Great Recession.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the time Trump took office, the debt totaled around 76% of GDP. But by mid 2020, it was 105% – a 29 percentage-point increase during his presidency. Economists often argue for paying down the debt when the economy is strong, and spending more when the economy is weak. But despite his promises to “get rid of” the debt, Trump has grown it in both good times and bad. While much of that increase came from coronavirus relief funds, earlier policies like corporate tax cuts and an increase in defense spending also fueled the rise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gross domestic product A deep recession\n",
      "\n",
      "The widest measure of economic activity — gross domestic product — measures the value of the goods and services produced in the country. It typically grows between 2% to 3% per year after adjusting for inflation. Trump’s first three years were all within that range, but 2020 saw a deep decline. We don’t have a full year of data yet, but the second quarter was the worst in records going back to 1947. Third-quarter data, which was released on Thursday, showed a partial recovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many economists predict businesses and workers will not fully bounce back from this severe economic downturn for years.\n",

      "(CNN) Although the result of the presidential election remains in the balance, there is no doubt in my mind President Donald Trump has run a historically bad campaign. At the root of his problem was his decision to put politics ahead of good policy. Case in point: failing to mobilize a national effort to fight the pandemic because he thought that owning the responsibility for a public health crisis was bad politics.\n",
      "\n",
      "In making that judgment, the President actually squandered the most powerful weapon an incumbent has in his arsenal -- the awesome power of the presidency and the ability to set the national agenda. By pretending Covid-19 would go away and dodging any responsibility for the deaths of more than 230,000 Americans, the President put himself on the defense for the entire campaign.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, what should he have done? First and foremost, he should have listened to and empowered the scientists and public health officials to lead the way. No one expects the President to go into a lab and come up with a cure himself. What they do expect is for a president to do everything he can to empower scientists to do their jobs. Instead, Trump spewed a near-constant stream of lies, thwarted infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci's ability to hammer home public health guidance, and undermined faith in the vaccine development process. At every turn, Trump has only made it harder for scientists to fight the raging pandemic. Despite the President's efforts to rush a vaccine through \"Operation Warp Speed,\" the country is still reeling from a surge in Covid cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, he should taken full responsibility for the fight against the coronavirus. Even if he wasn't motivated by doing the right thing, it would have been politically savvy to step up to the plate. This is a national crisis, and the public will always hold the President responsible. By shifting the blame to the governors, the President looked weak and lost any real ability to take credit for the fight against the virus. \"We want the states to administer these tests, for the most part,\" Trump said . \"We want them to do it, we're not going to be running a parking lot in Arkansas.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Politically, there is nothing more powerful for an incumbent President than to lead a national effort, bring the country together and demonstrate on a daily basis the awesome power of the presidency and the US government.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third, the President should have modeled good behavior. It quickly became apparent to the scientists that the most powerful defense against the virus for all Americans was staying home, social distancing, and wearing a mask. Clearly, these involved making personal sacrifices for the greater good. Trump, however, believed it was bad politics to ask people to modify their behavior and he defied his own public health experts almost from the start. Leaders like former President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and UK Prime Minister Winston Churchill drew great political power by speaking to the force of a country that comes together to face an existential challenge. Can you imagine either of these leaders saying food rationing or converting industries in the war effort was an infringement on personal liberty?\n",
      "\n",
      "Fourth, the President has executive emergency powers to mobilize resources from all corners of America. Trump likes to act like a strongman, but when it came time to wield power of the Defense Production Act, it seemed Trump was suddenly gun-shy. Instead of mounting an organized effort to source and produce medical equipment, Trump mostly sat on his hands, downplayed the risk of the virus, and turned down the opportunity to embody a wartime president.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, the biggest miscalculation the President made was hoping the problem would just go away. He completely mismanaged the expectations of the American people by consistently telling them things were going to improve -- despite evidence to the contrary. For 15 consecutive days, Trump said we were \"rounding the curve\" in defeating the virus, despite the fact that infections were spiking -- and still are -- to record levels. He also boasted that the virus \"is going to disappear. One day it's like a miracle, it will disappear.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When the virus refused to go away, Trump insisted on sticking to this alternate reality he created. Taking charge, setting expectations, mobilizing resources and empowering scientists would have made a world's difference. But the President didn't do any of these things. His strategy was to deflect and deny responsibility by blaming others. In doing so, he squandered the power of his office and fundamentally misunderstood the American public's ability to work together under the right leadership.\n",

Clinton also understood the American public knew a president could not solve every problem. But they expected him to try, and to use every resource available to meet the challenge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump has served himself poorly by ignoring this political lesson. Had he taken a more aggressive approach, owned the problem and demonstrated that he was doing everything he could, I suspect he would not be in the precarious position he finds himself today.

      "(CNN) South Africans are painfully aware that their country generally does not loom large, if at all, in the awareness of most Americans, nor in the policies of their government. But that doesn't mean they're not waiting with keen interest to see the outcome of Tuesday's race between Donald Trump and Joe Biden.\n",
      "\n",
      "US involvement in South Africa peaked during the Cold War. It has revived only recently , and sporadically at that, largely as a counter to Washington's unease over the growing influence of China, with that nation's ostensibly \"no strings attached\" economic assistance to Africa through its \" belt and road \" initiative.\n",
      "\n",
      "For historical reasons, South Africa's relationship with the US is a little different than other African nations. During the apartheid years, the White minority governments aligned themselves with the Western nations and leveraged SA's militarily strategic position to maximize British and US support. This support, articulated by President Ronald Reagan as \"constructive engagement,\" alienated the oppressed Black majority and left a lingering bad taste with many in Nelson Mandela's African National Congress, which has been the ruling party since South Africa's first democratic election in 1994.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump's outspokenness regularly ruffles feathers. There was anger when he tagged all of Africa, along with Haiti, as \" shithole\" countries, causing an affronted South African administration to summon the US chargé d'affaires for a dressing down.\n",
      "\n",
      "That it was a mere chargé d'affaires in the hot seat probably added to the slight. Trump took more than two years to replace President Barack Obama's highly regarded ambassador , and the eventual appointment was of a diplomatic neophyte, a Florida socialite and handbag designer whose apparent qualification for the job was being been born in South Africa.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a similar vein, and somewhat outrageously given that South Africa has its own problems with law enforcement's use of excessive force, President Cyril Ramaphosa's government seized on the #BlackLivesMatter protests to lament George Floyd's \"regrettable death\" and condescendingly observed that the incident \"[presented] the USA with an opportunity to address fundamental issues of human rights.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Venezuela, Many of the ANC's radical positions are rooted in socialist solidarity with the countries that backed it militarily during its revolutionary exile during the apartheid years -- the likes of Cuba, China and Russia. The government's views tend to be at odds with those of President Donald Trump's administration over Zimbabwe Iran , the recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, and the seemingly intractable issue of Palestinian statehood , of which Ramaphosa's government is a vocal supporter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whatever its antipathies, the Ramaphosa government has been scrupulous about not commenting publicly on the US elections. Privately, it has a preference for Biden, with a government analyst telling me that South Africa believes the Democratic candidate would return to the multilateralism that Trump has scorned and is expected to be less protectionist and isolationist when it comes to China. (While most South Africans have a positive view of China's investment in Africa, a Pew study found they expect the US to be more reliable ally than China in the future. The same study found that 42% of South Africans said last year that they had confidence Trump will do the right thing in world affairs.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Aside from slights and rhetoric, the US-SA relationship has remained remarkably unchanged under Trump. Trump did not carry out threats to slash funds to an admirable example of US largesse, the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS relief (PEPFAR) -- which has provided US $6.2 billion since the George W. Bush years to assist South Africa with one of world's largest HIV/AIDS burdens.\n",
      "\n",
      "And despite Trump's controversial 2018 tweet amplifying false claims about land seizures and the \" large-scale killing \" of White farmers, he did not follow up on lobbying by White rightist organizations to curb US assistance to South Africa because of concerns over proposed expropriation of White-owned farmland\n",
      "\n",
      "It's simplistic to assume that any Trump support that exists in Africa only comes from the White right. While many South Africans often view Trump's behavior as crass, others I've encountered see him as an admirably blunt crusader against political correctness and bureaucratic inertia. One example: Unathi Kwaza, who has served on the on the board of Free Market Foundation and on the council of the Institute of Race Relations, says that while she disagrees with Trump's tariff wars with China, she would love to see him in office for the next four years. \"He rubs the media the wrong way because he has never been politically correct. For me that is a great thing,\" she told me. \"There's nothing worse than not knowing what a person is really thinking because they're afraid others wouldn't approve.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump's stance on Israel has also drawn strong but quiet support from some sectors of South Africa's shrinking Jewish community , which numbers barely more than 50,000, equivalent to only 0.1% of the country's population of 58 million\n",
      "\n",
      "The dazzle of US power and influence can even beguile some who normally toe the ANC line. Mining tycoon Patrice Motsepe, a brother-in-law of Ramaphosa, had to backtrack rapidly after telling Trump at a World Economic Forum dinner in Davos that Africans love him and \"we want you to do well.\" Motsepe, after sharp public criticism, had to apologize for appearing to take on the mantle of spokesperson for Africa.\n",

      "From a developing world perspective, a salutary effect of the Trump years is that any American assumptions of exceptionalism have surely been shattered. Old and bitter social divides, long glossed over, are now on full display.\n",
      "\n",
      "America has revealed itself to be a nation as fallible as any other -- a nation that is struggling to mount the transparently \"free and fair\" elections that it has long lectured less fortunate countries on, and a nation where the incumbent hints at refusing to leave office on the basis of a \"stolen\" vote, long before the election has even taken place.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is the nature of feelings of national exceptionalism that a country imagines itself not only to be the center of the universe but to be more benign than others actually experience it. For those of us watching from a distance, the reality has proven to be somewhat different.\n",

      "President Donald Trump has consistently pointed to tax cuts and regulatory relief as key successes of his first four years in office. He has repeatedly pushed for the end of the Obama-era health law but has yet to deliver a plan to replace it. And he has spent most of this year defending his response to the coronavirus pandemic while fighting openly with scientists and medical experts about vaccines, treatments and more.\n",

      "___\n",
      "\n",
      "ECONOMY, TAXES AND THE DEBT\n",
      "\n",
      "Low unemployment and a soaring stock market were Trump’s calling cards before the pandemic. While the stock market clawed its way back after cratering in the early weeks of the crisis, unemployment stands at 7.9%, and the nearly 10 million jobs that remain lost since the pandemic began exceed the number that the nation shed during the entire 2008-09 Great Recession.\n",
      "\n",
      "And by Friday, Wall Street had closed out another punishing week with the S&P; 500 posting its first back-to-back monthly loss since the pandemic first gripped the economy in March. Much of the market’s focus has been on what’s to come for the economy when coronavirus counts are rising at troubling rates across Europe and the United States.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump has predicted that the U.S. economy will rebound in late 2020 and take off like a “rocket ship” in 2021. He promises that a coronavirus vaccine or effective therapeutics will soon be available, allowing life to get back to normal. His push for a payroll tax cut over the summer was thwarted by stiff bipartisan opposition. But winning a second term - and a mandate from voters - could help him resurrect the idea.\n",
      "\n",
      "An analysis from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates that Trump’s plan would increase the debt by about $5 trillion over 10 years. That’s on top of the $13 trillion in deficits the country is already expected to run up during that time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The national debt now stands at more than $20 trillion.\n",
      "\n",
      "___\n",
      "\n",
      "CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump insists that the country is “rounding the corner” on the pandemic and has stepped up calls on Democratic governors to lift coronavirus restrictions in their states. But Trump’s sunny outlook belies the ground truth in many states - including several critical to his path to 270 Electoral College votes - that have seen a surge in the virus.\n",
      "\n",
      "The president has often disputed medical experts in his own administration, among them infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci, on key issues surrounding the virus, including the timing of a vaccine, the need for social distancing and the importance of masks to contain the virus. His campaign rallies were filled with people gathered less than 6 feet apart without masks. His announcement of the nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court was widely regarded to be a super spreader event after he and several other people in attendance were diagnosed with the virus.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump spent three days at Walter Reed National Medical Center after his diagnosis. One of the drugs he received, remdesivir, has since been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of COVID-19.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump also says he’s “pretty damn certain” that vaccines and new treatments for the virus are coming in the not-so-distant future. Scientists are more cautious about the timing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Congress passed and Trump signed into law a more than $2 trillion coronavirus relief package earlier this year, but the two sides have been unable to agree on an additional aid package.\n",
      "\n",
      "___\n",
      "\n",
      "HEALTH CARE\n",
      "\n",
      "As a candidate for the White House, Trump promised that he would “immediately” replace former President Barack Obama’s health care law with a plan of his own that would provide “insurance for everybody” with lower costs. Americans are still waiting for a pan that Trump has been teasing for many months.\n",
      "\n",
      "He may be counting on the Supreme Court, which is scheduled to hear a case challenging “Obamacare” soon after the election. The court now has a solid conservative majority with the confirmation of Barrett as a justice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump officials say the administration has made strides by championing transparency on hospital prices, pursuing a range of actions to curb prescription drug costs and expanding lower-cost health insurance alternatives for small businesses and individuals. But those incremental steps fall far short of the sweeping changes he promised.\n",
      "\n",
      "The number of uninsured people has gone up on Trump’s watch, from 27.6 million people under age 65 in 2017 to 29.2 million last year, according to the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. There are no solid statistics on uninsured Americans this year, after millions lost job-related coverage in the pandemic.\n",
      "\n",
      "On prescription drugs, Trump came into office promising change so Americans would see the lower costs common in other economically advanced countries. But he backed away from a 2016 campaign promise to authorize Medicare to negotiate prices. And a big, bipartisan deal with Congress to reduce costs for Medicare recipients and restrain price increases eluded him.\n",
      "\n",
      "His administration did reach a narrower, yet significant agreement with drug companies and insurers to limit out-of-pocket costs for insulin for seniors to $35 a month. A series of regulations to try to curb drug costs remains a work in progress.\n",
      "\n",
      "___\n",
      "\n",
      "IMMIGRATION\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump worked through his first term to sharply curtail both legal and illegal immigration. Expect that to continue if he wins a second term.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of his top priorities would be to use agreements with Central American governments as models to get countries around the world to field asylum claims from people seeking refuge in the United States, a top adviser, Stephen Miller, recently told The Associated Press. He said the agreements would help stop “asylum fraud, asylum shopping and asylum abuse on a global scale.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Miller also forecast a broader offensive against so-called “sanctuary” jurisdictions that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities, saying the administration would use its “full power, resources and authority.” He vowed more efforts toward legal immigration “based on merit.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump’s pledge to build a wall along the U.S border with Mexico was a hallmark of his first presidential campaign and four years in office. Trump is expected to continue to trumpet progress after having completed nearly 400 miles of wall construction, though most of that replaced existing smaller barriers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump has yet to outline second-term immigration priorities in detail, though he has openly toyed with trying to repeal a constitutional right to citizenship for anyone born in the United States.\n",
      "\n",
      "His administration has long pursued a zero-tolerance policy to crack down on illegal immigration, and thousands of children were separated from their parents after crossing the border illegally. The administration was roundly criticized for its actions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Administration officials also sought to restrict legal immigration, including higher fees and increased scrutiny for people seeking to legally emigrate to the U.S. The administration slashed the number of refugees allowed in the country by about three-quarters to its lowest level in decades.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump has also sought to end Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, a program that allowed people brought to the United States illegally as children to remain as legal residents, though his effort was halted, at least temporarily, by the courts.\n",
      "\n",
      "___\n",
      "\n",
      "FOREIGN POLICY AND NATIONAL SECURITY\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump’s foreign policy centers on his mantra of “America First,” but in the months leading up to the election, he engaged in plenty of international diplomacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Trump administration scored a big win in recent weeks by nudging three Arab states - Bahrain, Sudan and the United Arab Emirates - to normalize relations with Israel, and Trump says more countries will follow. Historically, Arab nations have refused to recognize Israel until the Palestinians’ goal of an independent state was realized. Trump is aiming to create an alliance of countries against Iran.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump officials also brokered an economic cooperation agreement between Serbia and Kosovo, bitter foes in the Balkan wars. The administration, however, is still trying to reach an agreement with Russia to extend the last remaining arms control agreement between the two nations, which expires in early February.\n",
      "\n",
      "He counts as another major achievement his efforts to cajole more NATO members to fulfill their pledge to spend 2% of their gross domestic product on defense.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump also pulled the U.S. out of the Iran nuclear deal, saying it was one-sided in favor of Iran. He’s announced that the U.S. is withdrawing from the intermediate-range nuclear missile treaty with Russia and the Open Skies Treaty, which permits 30-plus nations to conduct observation flights over each other’s territory. He later said he might reconsider pulling out of that treaty.\n",
      "\n",
      "The president has reduced to about 3,000 the number of troops in Iraq. The U.S. plans to reduce the number of troops in Afghanistan to at least 4,500 in November, although Trump wants them all withdrawn by the end of the year. He also counts his engagement with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un as a foreign policy victory, yet he’s been unable to prod Kim to give up his nuclear program.\n",
      "\n",
      "___\n",
      "\n",
      "PUBLIC HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENT\n",
      "\n",
      "A Trump second term would begin to see a U.S. transformed by the scores of public health and environment rollbacks in Trump’s first term, when the administration weakened protections in landmark pollution laws that had stood for a half-century.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump’s biggest environmental rollbacks include removing federal protections for millions of miles of wetlands and waterways. That means mining companies and other industries will be freer to dump waste into the fragile habitats or destroy them outright, removing buffers against storms and flooding and making it harder for cities downstream to clean public water supplies, environmental groups say.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another major rollback means neighborhoods nationwide will find themselves having less say about highways or other big projects tearing through their communities. Other rollbacks enacted in Trump’s first term - in regulations ranging from endangered species to oil and gas and mining in federal wilderness to power plant pollution to water-thrifty dishwashers - will take effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "On climate change, Trump’s withdrawal of the United States from the Paris global climate accord would become official Nov. 4, the day after the presidential election. Trump is still fighting California and other Western states over his plans to ease future vehicle mileage standards, undoing another legacy climate effort of the Obama administration.\n",
      "\n",
      "A Supreme Court made more conservative by Trump’s appointments will decide pending court challenges by states and environmental groups to many of the rollbacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Trump administration says it wants to focus on helping minority communities that are disproportionately harmed by polluting industries in a second term. Environmental groups point to the administration’s efforts to slash funding for such programs, and call it an empty election-year promise.\n",
      "\n",
      "___\n",
      "\n",
      "EDUCATION\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump believes that a key to economic recovery from the virus is fully reopening schools, though Americans are wary. Only about 1 in 10 think day care centers, preschools or K-12 schools should open this fall without restrictions, according to a recent poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "He is calling for the expansion of charter schools and school choice programs, including a proposed tax credit for people who contribute to scholarships sending students to private schools and other education options. Under his watch, the federal government has also increased funding for historically Black colleges and universities - an effort he often cites as one of the things he has achieved for Black Americans.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump frequently rails against what he has described as “radical left indoctrination” in schools. He is pledging to create a commission to promote “patriotic education” in schools. Amid complaints that conservative voices are stifled on college campuses, he also sought to cut federal funding to colleges that do not protect speech rights.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump’s administration has revoked several Obama-era initiatives, including guidance intended to curb racial disparities in school discipline and a rule that sought to cut federal funding to for-profit colleges that left students with heavy debt.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Education Department under Trump has also created rules telling schools and universities how to respond to sexual misconduct, with more protection for the accused.\n",
      "\n",
      "___\n",
      "\n",
      "ABORTION\n",
      "\n",
      "Before becoming a presidential candidate, Trump described himself as a strong abortion-rights proponent. But after coming to Washington, he pushed for overturning Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court ruling that 47 years ago established a constitutional right to abortion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anti-abortion groups hope the addition of Barrett to the Supreme Court will provide a majority to overturn Roe. Barrett has declined to characterize Roe as a “super-precedent” that must not be overturned, although she says that she sets her personal views aside when weighing cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump also has barred federally funded family planning clinics from referring women for abortions. He supports the Hyde Amendment, a series of federal laws that ban the use of taxpayer money to pay for abortions except in cases of rape or incest or to save the woman’ s life.\n",
      "\n",
      "___\n",
      "\n",
      "SOCIAL SECURITY\n",
      "\n",
      "Even before the coronavirus shutdown sent the economy on a roller coaster ride, government experts estimated that Social Security would be unable to pay full benefits starting in 2035. The program’s insolvency date is now likely closer than that, because layoffs have cut into Social Security tax collections from workers and employers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump kept his promise not to cut Social Security benefits, but this summer he sent confusing signals with a plan to temporarily suspend collection of certain taxes that fund the program. While the White House staff said it was a limited measure that would have no lasting impact, Trump kept hinting to reporters that he had much bigger tax cuts in mind. Early in the year, he told an interviewer he wanted to tackle “entitlements,” or benefit programs, in a second term.\n",

      "___\n",
      "\n",
      "GUNS\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump has flirted at times with tighter gun laws. After the Parkland school shooting in Florida two years ago, Trump chided Republican lawmakers for being too “scared” of the National Rifle Association to tighten gun laws. And after back-to-back mass shootings in Ohio and Texas in 2019, he embraced calls for “strong background checks.” He backpedaled quickly in each instance.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the campaign, the president has repeatedly promised to “defend our Second Amendment.” The NRA’s political action committee has endorsed Trump.\n",

      "___\n",
      "\n",
      "VETERANS\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump frequently touts an expanded program at the Department of Veterans Affairs passed by Congress in 2018 that allows veterans to choose a private physician outside of the government-run VA system and still receive taxpayer-paid medical care.\n",
      "\n",
      "The program, first passed as a temporary measure during the Obama administration, was spurred by a 2014 scandal in which veterans died while waiting months for appointments at the Phoenix VA medical center. Trump supports giving veterans wide access to private-sector care if they are dissatisfied with VA treatment, and he has suggested he may issue additional regulations in a second term that will make it even easier.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump has boosted telehealth services at the VA and broadly promises an improved U.S. economy in a second term that will reduce veterans’ unemployment. He created a federal task force last year to address veterans suicide. In October, he signed into law a bipartisan bill that creates a new three-digit 988 phone line - similar to 911 - that will be reserved for mental health emergencies. It becomes active in fall 2021.\n",

      "Trump views the signing of two major trade deals - an updated pact with Mexico and Canada and the first phase of a China agreement - as signature achievements. The U.S. and China signed in January, less than two months before the pandemic put an enormous strain on U.S.-China relations. Trump says the first phase would lead to China buying roughly $200 billion over two years in U.S. agricultural products, energy and other American products.\n",
      "\n",
      "In return, the U.S. canceled or reduced tariffs on an array of China imports. So far, China is significantly behind in meeting its purchasing commitments, according to tracking from the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second phase of the deal is expected to focus on tougher issues between the countries, including Trump’s wish to get China to stop subsidizing its state-owned enterprises. But for Trump, who has come to frequently refer to the coronavirus as the “China virus,” it remains to be seen whether he will be able to effectively reengage Beijing on trade.

      "[TEXT] President Trump had a slightly bumpy relationship with Theresa May, the first British prime minister he had to deal with in his presidency.\n",
      "\n",
      "He arrived for his first visit to the UK as president on 12 July 2018 but it was immediately overshadowed by the publication of an interview the US president gave to The Sun newspaper.\n",
      "\n",
      "In it, he said the UK would \"probably not\" get a trade deal with the US if the prime minister's Brexit plan went ahead.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If they do a deal like that, we would be dealing with the European Union instead of dealing with the UK, so it will probably kill the deal,\" he told the paper, adding that Mrs May's plan \"will definitely affect trade with the United States, unfortunately in a negative way.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But at a joint news conference on the second day of his visit, he changed his tone and said a trade deal \"will absolutely be possible\" after the UK leaves the EU. He also said Brexit was an \"incredible opportunity\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Trump also met the Queen, although there was no open carriage ride with her through the streets of the capital as the trip was designated a \"working visit\" rather than an official state visit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Asked about the protests that greeted his arrival in the UK, he insisted many people were \"delighted\" he was visiting, adding: \"I get thousands of notifications from people in the UK that they love the president of the United States.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But when he arrived in London for a state visit the following year, he was welcomed by further protests and a giant balloon depicting him as a baby.\n",
      "\n",
      "This time around, the president was given the honour of a state banquet at Buckingham Palace with the Queen, during which he praised the \"eternal friendship\" between the UK and US.\n",
      "\n",
      "But earlier in the day, he had called London Mayor Sadiq Khan - who had said the UK should \"not roll out the red carpet\" for Mr Trump - a \"stone cold loser\".\n",
      "\n",
      "A few weeks later, Mr Trump also laid into Mrs May and her proposed Brexit deal, tweeting: \"What a mess she and her representatives have created. I told her how it should be done, but she decided to go another way.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So it was little surprise when Mr Trump appeared excited to congratulate Boris Johnson on becoming the new prime minister in July 2019, saying: \"He will be great!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When asked what advice he would give to Mr Johnson on Brexit, the president replied: \"He needs no advice. He's the right man for the job. I've been saying that for a long time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "While the pair have enjoyed warm personal relations, there have been some differences on policy, most notably on China, the Iran nuclear deal and the future of Nato.\n",

      "But after this year, they now have another thing in common - they both got and recovered from coronavirus. When Mr Johnson left intensive care back in April, Mr Trump said it was \"great news\" and after he returned to the White House to recover from the virus in October, he thanked the British PM for \"his friendship and support\".\n",

      "[TEXT] Some pollsters — including the New York Times/Siena poll — do show more undecided voters, voters backing a minor-party candidate, or voters who simply refuse to state whom they’ll back for president. Yet there’s little evidence that they’re poised to break unanimously for the president.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the final Times/Siena polls of the six battleground states likeliest to decide the election, the 8 percent of likely voters who didn’t back either Mr. Trump or Mr. Biden were slightly likelier than average to be young, nonwhite, less educated and male. They were slightly likelier than average to be registered Democrats. They disapproved of the president’s performance by the same modest margin as voters over all, and didn’t have a favorable view of either Mr. Biden or Mr. Trump. They were far less likely to have voted in a recent election. One wonders whether many of these voters will ultimately turn out at all, even though they say they will.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many more state pollsters now properly represent voters without a college degree. The failure of many state pollsters to do so four years ago is probably one of the biggest reasons the polls underestimated Mr. Trump. It’s not 100 percent solved in 2020, but it’s a lot better.\n",
      "\n",
      "The issue is simple: Voters without a college degree are less likely to respond to telephone surveys. To compensate, pollsters need to weight by education, which means giving more weight to certain respondents to ensure that less educated voters represent the appropriate share of a survey.\n",
      "\n",
      "This has been true for decades, but Democrats and Republicans used to fare about the same among white voters in both groups, so many political pollsters glossed over whether their samples had too many college graduates. That changed in 2016: Mr. Trump fared far better among white voters without a degree, and suddenly polls that had been accurate for years were woefully biased against Mr. Trump.\n",

      "Importantly, most national surveys in recent cycles weighted by education. There’s an arcane reason: They mainly sample all adults, and adjust their samples to match census demographic variables — like educational attainment. Many state polls, in contrast, called voters from lists of registered voters and adjusted their samples to match variables that voters provided when they registered to vote, like their party registration or age — but not their educational attainment.\n",

Although I think competition would make Google better. I think that it would actually improve if there were people that were actually nipping at their heels versus what they have now, which is just — and that’s why you’ll get results that feel like most of the first page is ads.

      "[TEXT] Mr. Trump’s apparent weakness in many of the country’s largest electoral prizes leaves him with a narrow path to the 270 Electoral College votes required to claim victory, short of a major upset or a systemic error in opinion polling surpassing even the missteps preceding the 2016 election. Should Mr. Biden’s lead hold in three of the four states tested in the survey, it would almost certainly be enough to win, and if he were to carry Florida, he would most likely need to flip just one more large state that Mr. Trump won in 2016 to clinch the presidency.\n",

      "In the closing days of the campaign, Mr. Biden has a modest advantage in Florida, where he is ahead of Mr. Trump by three points, 47 percent to 44 percent, a lead that is within the margin of error. He leads by six points in both Arizona and Pennsylvania. In no state did Mr. Trump’s support climb higher than 44 percent.\n",

      "Mr. Biden has consistently held the upper hand over Mr. Trump across the electoral map in polling conducted by The Times since late last spring. While that advantage has varied over time, and has differed from state to state, he has at no point slipped behind Mr. Trump in any of the swing states that are likeliest to decide the election.\n",

      "Mr. Biden’s lead is armored against last-minute developments in the race because of the scale of early and mail-in balloting that has already taken place as the country copes with a resurgence of the coronavirus.

Extrapolating that figure to the 18 rallies, they concluded that the gatherings ultimately resulted in more than 30,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and that the rallies had “likely led to more than 700 deaths,” though those deaths would not necessarily have occurred solely among attendees.\n",

Public health officials in states and counties where Mr. Trump has held rallies said in interviews this week that it was impossible to tie particular infections or outbreaks to the gatherings for several reasons: Caseloads are rising over all, rally attendees often travel from other locations, contact tracing is not always complete, and contact tracers do not always know where infected people have been.\n",

      "The Grand Rapids area is growing faster than any other part of Michigan and its suburbs are becoming more Democratic. Unhappiness with Trump is driving many well-educated voters, especially women and seniors, away from the Republican Party. The area is also becoming younger and more diverse.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There's no doubt that Kent County may be a little bit late to the swing county category, but it's arrived and it requires a visit and a message from the president to reassure those voters,\" Sellek says.\n",
      "\n",
      "Barack Obama flipped traditionally Republican Kent County in 2008, but Mitt Romney won it back in in 2012. In 2016, Trump won Kent by 9,400 votes, or 3%, a slimmer margin than Romney's victory there four years earlier.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2018, Democrat Gretchen Whitmer won Kent County by 11,600 votes in her successful campaign for governor.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a Grand Rapids visit, Sellek says Trump's best shot, at this point, may be to hold onto as many of Western Michigan's conservatives as he can and try to juice turnout in nearby rural counties for low-propensity voters likely to support him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To win, he needs to pull in as many of these conservative Christian voters as he can,\" Sellek says. \"His mission there will be to remind them of the importance of things like Amy Coney Barrett,\" Trump's most recent appointee to the Supreme Court, whom the Senate confirmed last week.\n",

      "Even if Trump is able to hold on to Florida, Arizona and North Carolina, as well as more traditionally solid Republican states that polls now indicate could be toss-ups, like Georgia and Texas, he can afford to lose only two of the three states — which is why he has made more than a dozen stops in the three states over the past week and has more planned in the campaign's final hours.\n",

      "[TEXT] WASHINGTON — Democrat Joe Biden maintains his double-digit national lead over Republican President Donald Trump in the final national NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll before the 2020 presidential election, with six-in-10 voters saying the country is on the wrong track, and with a majority disapproving of the president’s handling of the coronavirus.\n",
      "\n",
      "Biden is ahead of Trump nationally by 10 points among registered voters, 52 percent to 42 percent, in what has been a remarkably stable race over the course of a tumultuous year in American politics.\n",
      "\n",
      "The former Democratic vice president’s lead was 11 points in the NBC News/WSJ poll two weeks ago, 53 percent to 42 percent.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is the 11th survey we’ve done in 2020, and so little has changed,” said Democratic pollster Peter Hart, who conducted this survey with Republican pollster Bill McInturff of Public Opinion Strategies.\n",

      "“This is the most competitive election I could imagine if you’re down 10 points nationally,” said McInturff.\n",
      "\n",
      "Biden’s biggest advantages over Trump are with Black voters (87 percent to 5 percent), young voters ages 18-34 (60 percent to 32 percent), seniors (58 percent to 35 percent), women (57 percent to 37 percent), whites with college degrees (56 percent to 41 percent) and independents (51 percent to 36 percent).\n",

      "Trump, meanwhile, holds the edge among white voters (51 percent to 45 percent) and whites without degrees (58 percent to 37 percent).\n",

      "“Over the course of his term, there have been 41 NBC/WSJ polls that have measured Donald Trump’s performance as president,” said Democratic pollster Jeff Horwitt, who also helped conduct this survey. “In those 41 polls, there was not a single poll that produced a result where more Americans approved than disapproved of his performance as president.”\n",

      "And only 40 percent approve of the president’s handling of the coronavirus, while 57 percent disapprove — almost identical to what the last poll showed.\n",

      "\"Michigan's failure to provide accurate voter rolls violates federal law [and] jeopardizes the integrity of the upcoming 2020 federal election,\" the letter warned. If officials didn't clean up rolls \"bloated with ineligible voters,\" they'd be taken to court.\n",

      "Behind Snead's group, however, is a network that includes some of Washington's most powerful conservative figures, with close ties to the Republican Party and the Trump administration. Hundreds of pages of financial records and other documents, some not previously reported, lead back to Leonard Leo, an adviser to President Donald Trump and former executive vice president of the influential conservative legal group known as the Federalist Society.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although he doesn't hold public office, Leo has spent three decades helping to shift the American judiciary, including the Supreme Court, to the right. Now his network, backed by millions of dollars in untraceable \"dark money,\" is working to reshape the American vote.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alongside lawyers who also work for the Republican National Committee, Leo and his team during this election cycle have teed up lawsuits about voter rolls, run ads and filed court briefs to support litigation against mail-in voting. Leo is also on the advisory board of Lawyers for Trump, which is recruiting a battalion of lawyers ready to go to court in the wake of the election.\n",

      "\"It's a small circle of Republican advisers and donors who are all wrapped up in the same project,\" said David Daley, the author of \"Ratf**ked,\" a book about gerrymandering, and a senior fellow at FairVote, which advocates for electoral reform. \"The project is using redistricting, voting rights and the courts to ensure long-term Republican power.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Since 1988, Republicans have won the popular vote in a presidential election just once, in 2004. In March, Trump said on Fox & Friends that if the $3.6 billion congressional Democrats had requested to support elections during the pandemic had been approved, \"you'd never have a Republican elected in this country again.\"\n",

      "\"The president always says the quiet part out loud,\" said Sarah Longwell, a veteran Republican political strategist who broke with the party to co-found Republican Voters Against Trump.\n",

      "\n",
      "She spent years in Republican circles, she said, and \"never heard anybody talk about suppressing the vote.\" But in this cycle, she said, \"the lengths a lot of the Republicans are going to affect voting, those to me do look suppressive. Nakedly suppressive.\"\n",

      "In June, the Honest Elections Project made good on its threat over voter rolls, joining a local conservative activist to file suit in Michigan. Trump won the state by just 12,000 votes in 2016, the thinnest margin in the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "Michigan's Democratic secretary of state, Jocelyn Benson, who is fighting the lawsuit, rejects the characterization of state rolls as \"abnormally\" high. A spokesperson for her office said the project's methodology, which compares current voter registrations to slightly older population estimates, \"misleads the public and misunderstands our nation's laws.\"\n",

      "\"The goal is 100 percent voter registration, and any suggestion otherwise is antithetical to democracy,\" the spokesperson said. \"Michigan's registration rates are strong because we have had one of the best motor-voter systems in the country.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Snead rejected claims that the suit seeks to suppress the vote, pointing out that Michigan now allows same-day voter registration.\n",

      "\"I would strongly object to the notion that we're trying to stop people from voting when we're talking about cleaning up voter rolls,\" Snead said. \"What we're talking about should be no more controversial than throwing out a spoiled container of yogurt.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Michigan is among at least six swing states that have faced litigation this year over their voter rolls from conservative groups who said keeping voter rolls \"clean\" protects against election fraud. Voting rights advocates describe them as \"purges\" that disenfranchise low-income, minority and young voters, who tend both to move more and to vote Democratic.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a statement, the Trump campaign's deputy national press secretary, Thea McDonald, said: \"President Trump has clearly and consistently advocated for stable, understandable rules that will give every American faith in the election's results.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Democrats have duped the mainstream media into advocating for states to ignore the fact that their voter rolls are inaccurate and outdated,\" McDonald said, \"so that there are tens of thousands unclaimed ballots out there for harvesters to snatch and illegally cast, diluting the will of every eligible voter.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The rolls should be kept up to date, experts said, but officials need to weigh the risk of fraud against that of disenfranchisement.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There's very, very little evidence of voter fraud based upon voter rolls,\" said Paul Rosenzweig, a security expert and senior fellow at the R Street Institute, a right-leaning think tank. \"There's a lot of evidence that purging voter rolls ends up purging legitimate voters.\"\n",

      "Claims of widespread voter fraud have been largely debunked by experts, including Trump's own commission. The organization perhaps best known for asserting them is the Heritage Foundation, whose voter fraud database Snead managed before he moved to the Honest Elections Project.

      "Before helping Trump with his fight to keep his financial records secret, Consovoy was on the winning side of the Supreme Court case that gutted a key section of the Voting Rights Act, which had prevented areas with histories of racial discrimination from changing their voting rules without federal approval.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jason Torchinsky, listed as a plaintiff's counsel on the Michigan lawsuit with Consovoy, is a well-known lawyer for conservative dark money groups, including several linked to Leo. He has also represented the Republican National Committee in the past, and he is general counsel for the National Republican Redistricting Trust, the GOP group gearing up to do battle over redrawing state legislative and House district maps in 2021. In September, he represented Pennsylvania's GOP state senators in their unsuccessful Supreme Court petition to block the state's counting of late mail-in ballots.\n",

      "Further behind the scenes is Leo. A dapper Washington figure who wears distinctive round glasses, he has played a role in placing every one of the six conservative justices on the Supreme Court. In 1991, two years out of law school, he helped prep Thomas for his confirmation hearings.\n",
      "\n",
      "This year, Leo's network helped to push the confirmation of the court's newest member, Justice Amy Coney Barrett. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died Sept. 18, creating a vacancy. Leo's network immediately pledged to spend millions to advocate for Trump's right to fill the vacancy before the election.\n",

      "\n",
      "Soft power\n",
      "\n",
      "Leo's influence came from his position at the top of the Federalist Society, which he was instrumental in building. Thirty years ago, the organization was a scrappy island for conservatives in what they viewed as a sea of left-leaning legal institutions. Today, its 70,000 members range from law school students and leading legal scholars to Supreme Court justices and Trump's personal attorneys.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Federalist Society doesn't litigate or take policy positions. It doesn't have to, because its members have come to occupy positions of power across the legal landscape, said Steven Teles, a political science professor at Johns Hopkins University who wrote a book about the conservative legal movement.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's where a lot of the power comes from,\" he said. \"It can coordinate, even in an informal way, across boundaries that government often tends to stovepipe.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Leo moved smoothly across those borders. When a seat on the Supreme Court opened up under a Republican president, he'd take leave from the Federalist Society to organize \"the outside coalition efforts,\" as he did with the confirmations of Justice Samuel Alito and Chief Justice John Roberts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Until recently, he worked largely \"behind the scenes,\" said Amanda Hollis-Brusky, an associate professor of politics at Pomona College in Claremont, California, and the author of a book about the Federalist Society. \"Leo's influence really hasn't been fully felt until the Trump administration.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It began during the 2016 campaign, after the death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia that February.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don McGahn, a longtime Federalist Society member who served as the Trump campaign's counsel and would become the White House counsel, realized early that the judiciary could help rally a fractured Republican Party behind a controversial candidate. He pulled together a tight team to talk with Trump about who should fill Scalia's seat.\n",
      "\n",
      "In March 2016, Leo had a quiet meeting with Trump at McGahn's D.C. law firm, Jones Day. Soon after, the Trump campaign did something unheard of: It released a list of potential Supreme Court nominees, a signal to conservatives that he would do right by them with the judiciary.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I'm engaged in the battle of ideas, and I care very deeply about our Constitution and the role of courts in our society,\" Leo told The Washington Post in the paper's investigation into his work. \"And I don't waste my time on stories that involve money and politics.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But money and politics have been crucial to his success.\n",
      "\n",
      "The network\n",
      "\n",
      "Not long after Trump's victory, Leo stood in the gilded lobby of Trump Tower after a meeting with the president-elect.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beside him was Kellyanne Conway, Trump's campaign manager and counselor. Leo and Conway knew each other well. Her husband, George, was a longtime Federalist Society member; he has since become one of the right's most ardent \"Never Trumpers.\" And according to ethics filings, in the year before she joined the administration, she did consulting work for at least seven companies and nonprofits with close ties to Leo.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to Leo's role at the Federalist Society, where tax filings show he made about $400,000 a year, he was involved in a constellation of nonprofits and companies supporting conservative causes, fueled by tens of millions of dollars of largely untraceable cash.\n",
      "\n",
      "For years, Leo's presence in this tangled web \"was visible, but it wasn't official,\" said Anna Massoglia, a researcher at the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, who first wrote about Leo's connection to the Honest Elections Project. \"He's been effectively leaving breadcrumbs all over. It's just a matter of finding them and putting it together.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the most prominent of the interconnected groups was the Judicial Crisis Network, a Washington, D.C., nonprofit that has been the public relations machine supporting the nomination of conservative, originalist judges to the country's courts. The group has an office in the same building as the Federalist Society.\n",
      "\n",
      "After Scalia died, the Judicial Crisis Network kicked into gear. Its $7 million campaign helped block President Barack Obama's nominee, keeping Scalia's seat open for the next president to fill.\n",
      "\n",
      "In January 2017, the group announced that it would spend $10 million to back Trump's pick, who was soon revealed as Neil Gorsuch. Working with the Judicial Crisis Network were several figures who are now official partners in Leo's consolidated dark money network.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was Greg Mueller, the head of powerful CRC Public Relations, who ran point, according to a news release. He serves with Leo on the board of the anti-abortion rights group Students for Life of America. Leo would later join Mueller at the firm.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was also Gary Marx, a political strategist and Judicial Crisis Network senior adviser, who worked to build support in key states. Marx now leads the two main tax-exempt groups in Leo's new network, corporation filings show.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2018, the network rallied around the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh, which survived the most contentious set of hearings since Thomas faced Anita Hill in 1991. McGahn, the White House counsel at the time, coached Kavanaugh, who disputed accusations that he had assaulted Christine Blasey Ford as a teenager.\n",
      "\n",
      "Leo's network threw millions at the cause, including buying ads to pressure Democratic senators in red states to vote for confirmation.\n",
      "\n",
      "CRC reached out to reporters offering quotations from former Kavanaugh clerks. The PR firm was, according to Politico, also behind an ultimately embarrassing effort to exonerate Kavanaugh by claiming that someone else might have assaulted Ford.\n",
      "\n",
      "After Kavanaugh was confirmed, supporters gathered in the Senate's Mansfield Room for a private reception, Politico reported. Leo, Marx and Jonathan Bunch, Leo's right-hand man at the Federalist Society, were there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their quest undoubtedly was driven by a shared vision of the law and limited government. But it was also lucrative.\n",
      "\n",
      "All told, at least $330 million flowed through nonprofits linked to Leo from 2015 to 2018, according to an analysis by NBC News that built on a Washington Post tally done last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Millions flowed back to the men behind it. A company Leo owns in part received nearly $9 million, according to the tax filings of various nonprofits from 2016 through 2018. CRC, Mueller's company, brought in $9.3 million in that period.\n",
      "\n",
      "During Trump's first term, Leo's network helped him confirm more federal judges than any other administration had done since Jimmy Carter's. In addition to three Supreme Court justices, Trump appointed 220 federal judges, including 1 of every 4 circuit court judges.\n",
      "\n",
      "No compromises\n",
      "\n",
      "Leo's network is prepared for whatever follows Election Day.\n",
      "\n",
      "He began consolidating the existing strands this year. In January, he announced that he was leaving the Federalist Society to officially head up a push to spread \"big money and expertise across the conservative movement,\" as Axios put it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Leo implied that his effort was an answer to dark money groups on the left, which in 2018 outspent the conservative groups for the first time.\n",
      "\n",
      "He surrounded himself with a familiar list of names, essentially making his role official in a network he'd helped create.\n",
      "\n",
      "Leo became chairman of the newly branded CRC Advisors, Mueller's public relations firm. Bunch joined him.\n",
      "\n",
      "To move the \"big money,\" they revamped two tax-exempt organizations already in their network, with Marx at the helm.\n",
      "\n",
      "One became The 85 Fund, the fiscal sponsor of the Honest Elections Project.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The conservative movement is finally adopting some of the left's tactics, but the left is still spending far more,\" Marx said in a statement, pointing to the Arabella Advisors network, one of the largest left-leaning dark money networks. Like the Honest Elections Project, Arabella has said it is nonpartisan.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Judicial Crisis Network became an entity underneath The Concord Fund. It has given more than $2 million to the Republican Attorney Generals Association, financial disclosures show. Some of that money has gone to pay consulting and research fees to CRC.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Republican Attorney Generals Association backed Barrett's nomination to the Supreme Court. Several Republican attorneys general are also part of Lawyers for Trump, the group marshaling legal power for the election, which also includes Leo and Consovoy, the attorney for the Honest Elections Project suit in Michigan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Leo didn't respond to an interview request or a detailed list of questions. Neither did Consovoy or Torchinsky, the other attorney on the Michigan suit. The Republican National Committee, for which both Consovoy and Torchinsky have worked, didn't respond to a query.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Federalist Society, where Leo remains co-chairman of the board, reiterated that it doesn't \"take a position on legislation, litigation, candidates for office or judicial nominees.\" The spokesman who sent that response is a senior vice president at CRC Advisors.\n",
      "\n",
      "The support for conservative attorneys general could also be a sign of what's to come.\n",
      "\n",
      "Attorneys general have mounted aggressive political challenges to Washington over the past decade. Republicans in Oklahoma and Texas challenged Obama's environmental regulations and the Affordable Care Act. Their Democratic counterparts banded to block Trump policy changes on immigration and cuts to food stamps.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If Biden wins, Republican AGs in general are going to be a real thorn in the side of a Democratic administration, much like Democratic AGs have been for the Trump administration,\" said Paul Nolette, an associate professor of political science at Marquette University who runs a database that tracks litigation by attorneys general.\n",
      "\n",
      "If they rally together to file multistate litigation, as state attorneys general increasingly do, they will have an advantage — the ability to \"forum shop\" for like-minded judges, choosing which states and which federal courts in which to file their cases. The Trump administration's appointments have broadened their options.\n",

      "In a politically polarized landscape in which Congress is often gridlocked, policy fights are likely to land at the judiciary's feet. Some may like it that way.\n",

During his trip Friday to Rochester, his third rally of the day, he spoke for less than 30 minutes, rather than his more typical hour or more. At an event the next morning in Pennsylvania, his remarks were notably lower-key than usual. \"We'll see how it goes,\" he said at a rally in Newtown, Pennsylvania, that afternoon.\n",

I think they are not capturing the growth we are seeing in the minority communities.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "But while Trump continues to hold rallies in Michigan and Wisconsin, even his advisers who say he can pull off a victory on Election Day view winning those two states as a long shot, with polls consistently showing him trailing in both, sometime outside the polls' margins of error.\n",

      "That leaves Trump to rely heavily on Pennsylvania, where he held three rallies Saturday. An outside adviser has encouraged the campaign to pull resources from Michigan and Wisconsin and pour them into Pennsylvania — even though poll numbers have also shown Trump consistently trailing there.\n",
      "\n",
      "If Trump were to pull off another come-from-behind victory, those close to the campaign say, it will likely be because of the work the campaign has been doing for years to identify and engage new supporters, get them registered to vote and turn them out in the final days. The campaign is banking on even more white non-college-educated voters to turn out for Trump than in 2016 to help offset losses among other groups that strongly backed his run last time.\n",

      "\"There's very, very little evidence of voter fraud based upon voter rolls,\" said Paul Rosenzweig, a security expert and senior fellow at the R Street Institute, a right-leaning think tank. \"There's a lot of evidence that purging voter rolls ends up purging legitimate voters.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Claims of widespread voter fraud have been largely debunked by experts, including Trump's own commission. The organization perhaps best known for asserting them is the Heritage Foundation, whose voter fraud database Snead managed before he moved to the Honest Elections Project. Last year, he was also in Heritage's private election fraud briefing with Republican secretaries of state and active members of the Justice Department, as ProPublica first reported.\n",
      "\n",
      "While Snead insists that his organization doesn't fight for either party, the lawyers working with him are also leading the Republicans' legal battle over rules for the 2020 contest.\n",

      "William S. Consovoy, a former clerk to Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, is the head of a boutique Washington, D.C., law firm whose clients include the Republican National Committee and the Trump campaign. His firm has been paid $2 million this year for legal work on behalf of the Republican National Committee and the campaign, according to election filings, which included litigation against mail-in voting in Wisconsin. He is also one of Trump's private attorneys.\n",
      "\n",
      "William S. Consovoy, an attorney for President Donald Trump, leaves the federal courthouse in Washington on July 12, 2019. Manuel Balce Ceneta / AP file\n",
      "\n",
      "Before helping Trump with his fight to keep his financial records secret, Consovoy was on the winning side of the Supreme Court case that gutted a key section of the Voting Rights Act, which had prevented areas with histories of racial discrimination from changing their voting rules without federal approval.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jason Torchinsky, listed as a plaintiff's counsel on the Michigan lawsuit with Consovoy, is a well-known lawyer for conservative dark money groups, including several linked to Leo. He has also represented the Republican National Committee in the past, and he is general counsel for the National Republican Redistricting Trust, the GOP group gearing up to do battle over redrawing state legislative and House district maps in 2021. In September, he represented Pennsylvania's GOP state senators in their unsuccessful Supreme Court petition to block the state's counting of late mail-in ballots.\n",
      "\n",
      "Further behind the scenes is Leo. A dapper Washington figure who wears distinctive round glasses, he has played a role in placing every one of the six conservative justices on the Supreme Court. In 1991, two years out of law school, he helped prep Thomas for his confirmation hearings.\n",
      "\n",
      "This year, Leo's network helped to push the confirmation of the court's newest member, Justice Amy Coney Barrett. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died Sept. 18, creating a vacancy. Leo's network immediately pledged to spend millions to advocate for Trump's right to fill the vacancy before the election.\n",
      "\n",
      "The White House said in a statement that Barrett and Leo didn't speak \"after the vacancy arose.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As President Trump has said, he has no more solemn obligation and no greater honor than to appoint Supreme Court Justices and, as such, it was his decision alone to nominate this well-qualified jurist,\" White House deputy press secretary Judd Deere said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Should the election go to the high court, as many think it will, the justices Leo helped to seat will decide it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soft power\n",
      "\n",
      "Leo's influence came from his position at the top of the Federalist Society, which he was instrumental in building. Thirty years ago, the organization was a scrappy island for conservatives in what they viewed as a sea of left-leaning legal institutions. Today, its 70,000 members range from law school students and leading legal scholars to Supreme Court justices and Trump's personal attorneys.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Federalist Society doesn't litigate or take policy positions. It doesn't have to, because its members have come to occupy positions of power across the legal landscape, said Steven Teles, a political science professor at Johns Hopkins University who wrote a book about the conservative legal movement.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's where a lot of the power comes from,\" he said. \"It can coordinate, even in an informal way, across boundaries that government often tends to stovepipe.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Leo moved smoothly across those borders. When a seat on the Supreme Court opened up under a Republican president, he'd take leave from the Federalist Society to organize \"the outside coalition efforts,\" as he did with the confirmations of Justice Samuel Alito and Chief Justice John Roberts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Until recently, he worked largely \"behind the scenes,\" said Amanda Hollis-Brusky, an associate professor of politics at Pomona College in Claremont, California, and the author of a book about the Federalist Society. \"Leo's influence really hasn't been fully felt until the Trump administration.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It began during the 2016 campaign, after the death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia that February.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don McGahn, a longtime Federalist Society member who served as the Trump campaign's counsel and would become the White House counsel, realized early that the judiciary could help rally a fractured Republican Party behind a controversial candidate. He pulled together a tight team to talk with Trump about who should fill Scalia's seat.\n",
      "\n",
      "In March 2016, Leo had a quiet meeting with Trump at McGahn's D.C. law firm, Jones Day. Soon after, the Trump campaign did something unheard of: It released a list of potential Supreme Court nominees, a signal to conservatives that he would do right by them with the judiciary.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It ended up being the single biggest issue that brought Republicans home to someone they were largely troubled by,\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., told The New York Times.\n",

      "Former White House counsel Don McGahn arrives at the Justice Department on May 9, 2019. Andrew Harnik / AP file\n",
      "\n",
      "Leo has always insisted that his mission is intellectual.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm engaged in the battle of ideas, and I care very deeply about our Constitution and the role of courts in our society,\" Leo told The Washington Post in the paper's investigation into his work. \"And I don't waste my time on stories that involve money and politics.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But money and politics have been crucial to his success.\n",
      "\n",
      "The network\n",
      "\n",
      "Not long after Trump's victory, Leo stood in the gilded lobby of Trump Tower after a meeting with the president-elect.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beside him was Kellyanne Conway, Trump's campaign manager and counselor. Leo and Conway knew each other well. Her husband, George, was a longtime Federalist Society member; he has since become one of the right's most ardent \"Never Trumpers.\" And according to ethics filings, in the year before she joined the administration, she did consulting work for at least seven companies and nonprofits with close ties to Leo.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to Leo's role at the Federalist Society, where tax filings show he made about $400,000 a year, he was involved in a constellation of nonprofits and companies supporting conservative causes, fueled by tens of millions of dollars of largely untraceable cash.\n",
      "\n",
      "For years, Leo's presence in this tangled web \"was visible, but it wasn't official,\" said Anna Massoglia, a researcher at the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, who first wrote about Leo's connection to the Honest Elections Project. \"He's been effectively leaving breadcrumbs all over. It's just a matter of finding them and putting it together.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the most prominent of the interconnected groups was the Judicial Crisis Network, a Washington, D.C., nonprofit that has been the public relations machine supporting the nomination of conservative, originalist judges to the country's courts. The group has an office in the same building as the Federalist Society.\n",
      "\n",
      "After Scalia died, the Judicial Crisis Network kicked into gear. Its $7 million campaign helped block President Barack Obama's nominee, keeping Scalia's seat open for the next president to fill.\n",
      "\n",
      "In January 2017, the group announced that it would spend $10 million to back Trump's pick, who was soon revealed as Neil Gorsuch. Working with the Judicial Crisis Network were several figures who are now official partners in Leo's consolidated dark money network.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was Greg Mueller, the head of powerful CRC Public Relations, who ran point, according to a news release. He serves with Leo on the board of the anti-abortion rights group Students for Life of America. Leo would later join Mueller at the firm.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was also Gary Marx, a political strategist and Judicial Crisis Network senior adviser, who worked to build support in key states. Marx now leads the two main tax-exempt groups in Leo's new network, corporation filings show.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2018, the network rallied around the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh, which survived the most contentious set of hearings since Thomas faced Anita Hill in 1991. McGahn, the White House counsel at the time, coached Kavanaugh, who disputed accusations that he had assaulted Christine Blasey Ford as a teenager.\n",
      "\n",
      "Leo's network threw millions at the cause, including buying ads to pressure Democratic senators in red states to vote for confirmation.\n",
      "\n",
      "CRC reached out to reporters offering quotations from former Kavanaugh clerks. The PR firm was, according to Politico, also behind an ultimately embarrassing effort to exonerate Kavanaugh by claiming that someone else might have assaulted Ford.\n",
      "\n",
      "After Kavanaugh was confirmed, supporters gathered in the Senate's Mansfield Room for a private reception, Politico reported. Leo, Marx and Jonathan Bunch, Leo's right-hand man at the Federalist Society, were there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their quest undoubtedly was driven by a shared vision of the law and limited government. But it was also lucrative.\n",
      "\n",
      "All told, at least $330 million flowed through nonprofits linked to Leo from 2015 to 2018, according to an analysis by NBC News that built on a Washington Post tally done last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Millions flowed back to the men behind it. A company Leo owns in part received nearly $9 million, according to the tax filings of various nonprofits from 2016 through 2018. CRC, Mueller's company, brought in $9.3 million in that period.\n",
      "\n",
      "During Trump's first term, Leo's network helped him confirm more federal judges than any other administration had done since Jimmy Carter's. In addition to three Supreme Court justices, Trump appointed 220 federal judges, including 1 of every 4 circuit court judges.\n",
      "\n",
      "No compromises\n",
      "\n",
      "Leo's network is prepared for whatever follows Election Day.\n",
      "\n",
      "He began consolidating the existing strands this year. In January, he announced that he was leaving the Federalist Society to officially head up a push to spread \"big money and expertise across the conservative movement,\" as Axios put it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Leo implied that his effort was an answer to dark money groups on the left, which in 2018 outspent the conservative groups for the first time.\n",
      "\n",
      "He surrounded himself with a familiar list of names, essentially making his role official in a network he'd helped create.\n",
      "\n",
      "Leo became chairman of the newly branded CRC Advisors, Mueller's public relations firm. Bunch joined him.\n",
      "\n",
      "To move the \"big money,\" they revamped two tax-exempt organizations already in their network, with Marx at the helm.\n",
      "\n",
      "One became The 85 Fund, the fiscal sponsor of the Honest Elections Project.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The conservative movement is finally adopting some of the left's tactics, but the left is still spending far more,\" Marx said in a statement, pointing to the Arabella Advisors network, one of the largest left-leaning dark money networks. Like the Honest Elections Project, Arabella has said it is nonpartisan.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Judicial Crisis Network became an entity underneath The Concord Fund. It has given more than $2 million to the Republican Attorney Generals Association, financial disclosures show. Some of that money has gone to pay consulting and research fees to CRC.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Republican Attorney Generals Association backed Barrett's nomination to the Supreme Court. Several Republican attorneys general are also part of Lawyers for Trump, the group marshaling legal power for the election, which also includes Leo and Consovoy, the attorney for the Honest Elections Project suit in Michigan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Leo didn't respond to an interview request or a detailed list of questions. Neither did Consovoy or Torchinsky, the other attorney on the Michigan suit. The Republican National Committee, for which both Consovoy and Torchinsky have worked, didn't respond to a query.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Federalist Society, where Leo remains co-chairman of the board, reiterated that it doesn't \"take a position on legislation, litigation, candidates for office or judicial nominees.\" The spokesman who sent that response is a senior vice president at CRC Advisors.\n",
      "\n",
      "The support for conservative attorneys general could also be a sign of what's to come.\n",
      "\n",
      "Attorneys general have mounted aggressive political challenges to Washington over the past decade. Republicans in Oklahoma and Texas challenged Obama's environmental regulations and the Affordable Care Act. Their Democratic counterparts banded to block Trump policy changes on immigration and cuts to food stamps.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If Biden wins, Republican AGs in general are going to be a real thorn in the side of a Democratic administration, much like Democratic AGs have been for the Trump administration,\" said Paul Nolette, an associate professor of political science at Marquette University who runs a database that tracks litigation by attorneys general.\n",
      "\n",
      "If they rally together to file multistate litigation, as state attorneys general increasingly do, they will have an advantage — the ability to \"forum shop\" for like-minded judges, choosing which states and which federal courts in which to file their cases. The Trump administration's appointments have broadened their options.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a politically polarized landscape in which Congress is often gridlocked, policy fights are likely to land at the judiciary's feet. Some may like it that way.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"For partisans, it's an appealing avenue,\" Nolette said. \"It doesn't force the two sides to come to a compromise.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Like an election, he said, a lawsuit is \"largely win or lose.\"\n"
