The nation reported more than 71,600 new coronavirus cases on Thursday, approaching a record number of daily infections set in late July.\\n\\nEven for countries that have successfully suppressed their outbreaks, Tedros said \"now is the time to double down\" and to take quick action for arising clusters.\\n\\n\"We urge leaders to take immediate action to prevent further unnecessary deaths, essential health services from collapsing and schools shutting again,\" Tedros said at the organization\\'s Geneva headquarters. \"This is not a drill.\"\\n\\nDr. Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO\\'s health emergencies program, said a second wave of infections is \"not only possible but highly likely anywhere in the world.\" Ryan said some countries that have been able to suppress their outbreaks didn\\'t \"follow through\" on testing, contact tracing and isolation, along with other measures to reduce the virus\\' transmission, and allowed the disease to \"creep back in.\"\\n\\n\"No country is out of the woods,\" he said.\\n\\nWhile new cases have accelerated, coronavirus fatalities have remained relatively stable, according to the WHO. However, fatalities typically lag infections by a few weeks. Deaths have started to creep up in Europe, the Eastern Mediterranean region and Africa over the last seven days.\\n\\n\"We need to prevent transmission, but we also need to focus on reducing the death toll, which will rise in the coming days — I have no doubt,\" Ryan said.',\n",

New coronavirus cases eclipsed 71,600 on Thursday.\\n\\nGottlieb, a physician who served as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration commissioner, emphasized that doctors have improved their treatment of Covid-19 patients during the pandemic, bringing down the mortality rate. He has said it might have been reduced by 50%.\\n\\nPatient care also has been improved due to drugs such as Gilead Sciences\\' remdesivir, which on Thursday became an FDA-approved treatment for Covid-19, as well as the use of steroids such as dexamethasone, according to Gottlieb. President Donald Trump received both after his coronavirus diagnosis.\\n\\nDespite these positive developments, Gottlieb said the challenge the U.S. is facing now is simply how widespread the virus is across the country. \"Mortality is going to be down, but we\\'re going to be infecting so many people that the daily death statistics are going to be staggering,\" said Gottlieb, who led the FDA under Trump from May 2017 to April 2019.\\n\\nThere could be \"well above 1,000\" new deaths per day reported in the weeks ahead, he said. \"And we might retest some of the totals that we saw in the spring, when we were reporting 2,000 deaths a day related to this virus, just because of the sheer number of people we\\'re likely to infect heading into the winter right now.\"\\n\\nThe U.S. has almost 8.5 million confirmed cases of Covid-19 and at least 223,752 people have died, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.\\n\\nPublic health experts have been warning for months that colder weather during the fall and winter is likely to coincide with a resurgence of the coronavirus because people are spending more time indoors, where transmission can more easily occur.\\n\\nThe pandemic is intensifying in countries across the world, and some nations are on a \"dangerous track,\" the head of the World Health Organization warned Friday. \"We are at a critical juncture in this pandemic, particularly in the Northern Hemisphere,\" Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.\\n\\nRestrictions have again been implemented in parts of Europe, including an overnight curfew in regions of France, in an attempt to reduce the spread of Covid-19.\\n\\nGottlieb said he believes the response in the U.S. to rising infection rates will be targeted interventions in hot-spot areas, rather than the lockdown orders that were issued in the early stages of the pandemic when inadequate testing regimes made it difficult to determine where transmission was happening.\\n\\n\"I think we\\'re going to bear a lot more infection ... and the health-care system is going to have to bear the brunt of this burden, because I don\\'t think you have the popular will for stay-at-home orders or broad mitigation,\" he said.\\n\\n\"If everyone would just wear masks, that would cut down on the spread,\" he added.\\n\\n— CNBC\\'s Noah Higgins-Dunn contributed to this report.',\n",

Racism is ingrained in our society. And we all know it, I mean people don\\'t like to admit it, but we all know it,\" he said. \"This is a long-standing problem in America, because we actually have never had that reconciliation type of discussion, and people seem to be afraid of it,\" he said. \"And the interesting thing is that Black people are not afraid of it, we\\'re fine to have that conversation, but I think that White people feel very nervous about it and I\\'m not really sure why,\" he continued.',\n",

The global death toll stood Monday at more than 1.1 million.\\n\\nNew York\\'s new round of virus shutdowns zeroes in on individual neighborhoods, closing schools and businesses in hot spots measuring just a couple of square miles.\\n\\nSpanish officials limited travel to and from some parts of Madrid before restrictions were widened throughout the capital and some suburbs.\\n\\nItalian authorities have sometimes quarantined spots as small as a single building.\\n\\nGet Breaking News Delivered to Your Inbox\\n\\nWhile countries including Israel and the Czech Republic have reinstated nationwide closures, other governments hope smaller-scale shutdowns can work this time, in conjunction with testing, contact tracing and other initiatives they\\'ve now built up.\\n\\nThe concept of containing hot spots isn\\'t new, but it\\'s being tested under new pressures as authorities try to avoid a dreaded resurgence of illness and deaths, this time with economies weakened from earlier lockdowns, populations chafing at the idea of renewed restrictions and some communities complaining of unequal treatment.\\n\\nSome scientists say a localized approach, if well-tailored and explained to the public, can be a nimble response at a complex point in the pandemic.\\n\\n\"It is pragmatic in appreciation of \\'restriction fatigue\\' ... but it is strategic, allowing for mobilization of substantial resources to where they are needed most,\" says Dr. Wafaa El-Sadr, who is following New York City\\'s efforts closely and is on some city advisory boards.\\n\\nOther scientists are warier.\\n\\n\"If we\\'re serious about wiping out COVID in an area, we need coordinated responses across\" as wide a swath as possible, says Benjamin Althouse, a research scientist with the Institute for Disease Modeling in Washington state.\\n\\nIn a study that has been posted online but not published in a journal or reviewed by independent experts, Althouse and other scientists found that amid patchwork coronavirus-control measures in the U.S. this spring, some people traveled farther than usual for such activities as worship, suggesting they might have responded to closures by hopscotching to less-restricted areas.\\n\\nStill, choosing between limited closures and widespread restrictions is \"a very, very difficult decision,\" Althouse notes. \"I\\'m glad I\\'m not the one making it.\"\\n\\nEarly in the outbreak, countries tried to quell hot spots from Wuhan, China — where a stringent lockdown was seen as key in squelching transmission in the world\\'s most populous nation — to Italy, where a decision to seal off 10 towns in the northern region of Lombardy evolved within weeks into a nationwide lockdown.\\n\\nAfter the virus\\'s first surge, officials fought flare-ups with city-sized closures in recent months in places from Barcelona, Spain, to Melbourne, Australia.\\n\\nIn the English city of Leicester, nonessential shops were shut down and households banned from mixing in late June. The infection rate fell, dropping from 135 cases per 100,000 to around 25 cases per 100,000 in about two months.\\n\\nProponents took that as evidence localized lockdowns work. Skeptics argued that summertime transmission rates were generally low anyway in the United Kingdom, where the official coronavirus death toll of over 43,000 stands as Europe\\'s highest, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University.\\n\\nWith infection levels and deaths rising anew in Britain, scientists advised officials to implement a national, two-week lockdown. Instead, the government last week carved England into three tiers of coronavirus risk, with restrictions ranging accordingly.\\n\\n\"As a general principle, the targeting of measures to specific groups or geographical areas is preferable to one-size-fits-all measures, because they allow us to minimize the damage that social distancing inevitably imposes on society and the economy,\" said Flavio Toxvaerd, who specializes in economic epidemiology at the University of Cambridge.\\n\\nThe damage doesn\\'t feel so minimal to Steven Goldstein, who had to close his New York City men\\'s hat shop last week.\\n\\nThe 72-year-old business, Bencraft Hatters, is in one of a handful of small areas around the state with new restrictions. Authorities hope they\\'ll avert a wider crisis in a state that beat back the deadliest spike in the U.S. this spring, losing over 33,000 people to date.\\n\\nGoldstein takes the virus seriously — he said he and his mother both had it early on — and he sees the economic rationale behind trying local restrictions instead of another citywide or statewide shutdown.\\n\\nBut he questions whether the zones are capturing all the trouble spots, and he\\'s rankled that the restrictions are falling on his shop after, he says, he faithfully enforced mask-wearing and other rules.\\n\\n\"I did my part, and a lot of other people did our part, and yet we\\'re being forced to close,\" said Goldstein, 53, who tapped into savings to sustain the third-generation business through the earlier shutdown.',\n",

       "  'text': 'New York — After entire nations were shut down during the first surge of the coronavirus earlier this year, some countries and U.S. states are trying more targeted measures as cases rise again around the world, especially in the United States, Europe and Latin America. Data compiled by the Johns Hopkins University showed that, as of Monday, more than 40 million people had contracted the virus since the disease was first detected in Wuhan, China, late last year. The global death toll stood Monday at more than 1.1 million.\\n\\nNew York\\'s new round of virus shutdowns zeroes in on individual neighborhoods, closing schools and businesses in hot spots measuring just a couple of square miles.\\n\\nSpanish officials limited travel to and from some parts of Madrid before restrictions were widened throughout the capital and some suburbs.\\n\\nItalian authorities have sometimes quarantined spots as small as a single building.\\n\\nGet Breaking News Delivered to Your Inbox\\n\\nWhile countries including Israel and the Czech Republic have reinstated nationwide closures, other governments hope smaller-scale shutdowns can work this time, in conjunction with testing, contact tracing and other initiatives they\\'ve now built up.\\n\\nThe concept of containing hot spots isn\\'t new, but it\\'s being tested under new pressures as authorities try to avoid a dreaded resurgence of illness and deaths, this time with economies weakened from earlier lockdowns, populations chafing at the idea of renewed restrictions and some communities complaining of unequal treatment.\\n\\nSome scientists say a localized approach, if well-tailored and explained to the public, can be a nimble response at a complex point in the pandemic.\\n\\n\"It is pragmatic in appreciation of \\'restriction fatigue\\' ... but it is strategic, allowing for mobilization of substantial resources to where they are needed most,\" says Dr. Wafaa El-Sadr, who is following New York City\\'s efforts closely and is on some city advisory boards.\\n\\nOther scientists are warier.\\n\\n\"If we\\'re serious about wiping out COVID in an area, we need coordinated responses across\" as wide a swath as possible, says Benjamin Althouse, a research scientist with the Institute for Disease Modeling in Washington state.\\n\\nIn a study that has been posted online but not published in a journal or reviewed by independent experts, Althouse and other scientists found that amid patchwork coronavirus-control measures in the U.S. this spring, some people traveled farther than usual for such activities as worship, suggesting they might have responded to closures by hopscotching to less-restricted areas.\\n\\nStill, choosing between limited closures and widespread restrictions is \"a very, very difficult decision,\" Althouse notes. \"I\\'m glad I\\'m not the one making it.\"\\n\\nEarly in the outbreak, countries tried to quell hot spots from Wuhan, China — where a stringent lockdown was seen as key in squelching transmission in the world\\'s most populous nation — to Italy, where a decision to seal off 10 towns in the northern region of Lombardy evolved within weeks into a nationwide lockdown.\\n\\nAfter the virus\\'s first surge, officials fought flare-ups with city-sized closures in recent months in places from Barcelona, Spain, to Melbourne, Australia.\\n\\nIn the English city of Leicester, nonessential shops were shut down and households banned from mixing in late June. The infection rate fell, dropping from 135 cases per 100,000 to around 25 cases per 100,000 in about two months.\\n\\nProponents took that as evidence localized lockdowns work. Skeptics argued that summertime transmission rates were generally low anyway in the United Kingdom, where the official coronavirus death toll of over 43,000 stands as Europe\\'s highest, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University.\\n\\nWith infection levels and deaths rising anew in Britain, scientists advised officials to implement a national, two-week lockdown. Instead, the government last week carved England into three tiers of coronavirus risk, with restrictions ranging accordingly.\\n\\n\"As a general principle, the targeting of measures to specific groups or geographical areas is preferable to one-size-fits-all measures, because they allow us to minimize the damage that social distancing inevitably imposes on society and the economy,\" said Flavio Toxvaerd, who specializes in economic epidemiology at the University of Cambridge.\\n\\nThe damage doesn\\'t feel so minimal to Steven Goldstein, who had to close his New York City men\\'s hat shop last week.\\n\\nThe 72-year-old business, Bencraft Hatters, is in one of a handful of small areas around the state with new restrictions. Authorities hope they\\'ll avert a wider crisis in a state that beat back the deadliest spike in the U.S. this spring, losing over 33,000 people to date.\\n\\nGoldstein takes the virus seriously — he said he and his mother both had it early on — and he sees the economic rationale behind trying local restrictions instead of another citywide or statewide shutdown.\\n\\nBut he questions whether the zones are capturing all the trouble spots, and he\\'s rankled that the restrictions are falling on his shop after, he says, he faithfully enforced mask-wearing and other rules.\\n\\n\"I did my part, and a lot of other people did our part, and yet we\\'re being forced to close,\" said Goldstein, 53, who tapped into savings to sustain the third-generation business through the earlier shutdown.',\n",

Dozens of candidate vaccines are in clinical evaluation, according to the World Health Organization, with some already conducting late-stage tests before seeking formal approval. The outcome of the trials is being closely monitored around the world. The U.S.\\'s leading expert on infectious disease believes it will only be a matter of weeks before the findings of a potential vaccine will be known. \"We will know whether a vaccine is safe and effective by the end of November, the beginning of December,\" White House coronavirus advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said in a BBC interview on Sunday. \"The question is: Once you have a safe and effective vaccine, or more than one, how can you get it to the people who need it as quickly as possible?\"\\n\\nFauci said a vaccine deemed safe and effective would be rolled out according to a set prioritization, with individuals such as health care workers and those in a higher risk category likely to receive the first doses. He said it would be \"several months into 2021\" before a vaccine becomes more widely available. The development of a vaccine, Fauci warned, would not replace the need for public health measures to help protect people from the disease for some time. To date, more than 43 million people have contracted the coronavirus worldwide, with 1.15 million related deaths, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.\\n\\nVaccine race\\n\\nThe race for a Covid vaccine has seen governments step in to try to help the process along by providing funds to allow companies to scale up manufacturing even before drugs have been approved. Leo Varadkar, Ireland\\'s deputy prime minister, has said he is hopeful an inoculation against the coronavirus could be approved before the end of the year. \"I\\'m increasingly optimistic, as is government, that we will see a vaccine approved in the next couple of months and that in the first half or first quarter of next year it\\'ll be possible to start vaccinating those most at risk,\" Varadkar, who is a qualified doctor, told RTE radio on Sunday.\\n\\nA Rehab Support worker checks on patient notes as the first patients are admitted to the NHS Seacole Centre at Headley Court, Surrey, a disused military hospital, which has been converted during the coronavirus pandemic. Victoria Jones | PA Images via Getty Images\\n\\nNot all public health experts share the same level of optimism about the development of a Covid vaccine before year-end, however. The Mail on Sunday reported plans had been drawn up for frontline National Health Service staff to receive a coronavirus vaccine within weeks, citing an email sent by an NHS Trust chief to his staff. In response to the report, U.K. Health Minister Matt Hancock said on Monday that it was not the government\\'s expectation for NHS staff to receive access to a potential vaccine this year. He did rule out the possibility of a Covid vaccine being delivered to hospital staff in 2020 but said the bulk of the rollout would likely take place in the first half of next year. The U.K.\\'s chief scientific advisor, Patrick Vallance, has said he doesn\\'t believe a Covid vaccine will be available for widespread use in the community until at least the spring. He also told the National Security Strategy Committee in London last week that the coronavirus was likely to become as endemic as the annual flu. This means the infection rate of the coronavirus, like other coronaviruses, will eventually stabilize at a constant level so that the virus becomes present in communities at all times. Vallance said creating a vaccine from scratch took approximately 10 years on average. The fastest vaccine ever developed was for mumps, and it took more than four years.\\n\\nSmall bottles labeled with a \"Vaccine COVID-19\" sticker and a medical syringe are seen in this illustration taken taken April 10, 2020.

Zambia\\'s confirmed COVID-19 cases have continued rising, with the total number close to the 10,000 mark. Xinhua/Martin Mbangweta via Getty Images\\n\\nZambia has three weeks to improve transparency over its debt obligations and make progress toward an IMF-backed reform package, or risk defaulting on its loans. Last week, a meeting of creditors was adjourned until Nov. 13 after a consortium comprising around 40% of Zambia\\'s Eurobond holders opted to abstain from voting on the country\\'s debt relief proposals, rather than voting them down. Experts suggest bondholders are hoping the government can offer more clarity on its debt, particularly to China, and demonstrate progress toward an IMF program ahead of the Nov. 13 meeting. \"However, if no progress is made then there is no reason to suspect that bondholders will soften their stance, which will push Zambia into default when its grace period expires on 13 November and will signal a potentially acrimonious restructuring process ahead,\" said Patrick Curran, senior economist at emerging markets consultancy Tellimer. S&P Global Ratings on Thursday downgraded Zambia\\'s foreign currency rating to \"selective default.\" \"We view the nonpayment of debt service and the statement that the government will not make debt service payments as a default on its commercial debt obligations,\" the ratings agency said in its update, forecasting that Zambia will remain in payment default for \"at least the six months of the standstill period\" as the government works toward debt restructuring.\\n\\nHow did Zambia get here?\\n\\nOn Oct. 13, the Zambian government announced it would suspend debt service payments to external commercial creditors, citing liquidity challenges compounded by the coronavirus pandemic. It has since failed to make an interest payment due on Oct. 14 for its 2024 Eurobond. Eurobonds are debt instruments denominated in any currency other than that of the issuer. The government had on Sept. 22 asked Eurobond holders to agree to a temporary debt repayment freeze. However, Zambia\\'s problems long predate the coronavirus crisis, with its economy constrained by structural factors such as low wealth, high fiscal deficits and a heavy debt burden.\\n\\nLUSAKA, ZAMBIA - November 20: Edgar Chagwa Lungu, President of Zambia, on November 20, 2015 in Lusaka, Zambia. Thomas Trutschel/Photothek via Getty Images\\n\\nTellimer\\'s Curran told CNBC that these issues had been compounded by \"excessively lax fiscal policy\" since President Edgar Lungu came to power in 2015. \"Over this period the budget deficit has averaged nearly 8% of GDP, driven mainly by a massive pipeline of Chinese-backed infrastructure projects,\" he continued. \"With most debt denominated in dollars, sharp kwacha depreciation has exacerbated Zambia\\'s fiscal problems and pushed debt from around 36% of GDP in 2014 to 92% by the of 2019.\" While an IMF-backed reform package has been repeatedly promised by the government, it has consistently balked at austerity measures, and Curran said the country\\'s credibility has been \"squandered\" with the IMF and creditors.\\n\\nTransparency and Chinese debt\\n\\nGiven Zambia\\'s pre-existing vulnerabilities, Curran suggested it should not be used as a bellwether for other African sovereigns post-Covid, but he said its restructuring effort could offer important lessons for other nations seeking bilateral debt relief. In particular, the government\\'s seeking of private sector involvement is a first among countries included in the World Bank\\'s Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI).\\n\\nBEIJING, CHINA - MARCH 30: Chinese Premier Li Keqiang (2nd-R) meets Zambia\\'s President Edgar Chagwa Lungu (2nd-L) at the Great Hall of the People on March 30, 2015 in Beijing, China. Feng Li-Pool/Getty Images\\n\\nThe key issue for bondholders remains a lack of clarity on the size, composition and terms of Chinese funding and assurances that an IMF program is imminent. Although clearly problematic for Eurobond creditors, Zambia\\'s decision to skip payment seems to have found favor with Beijing, with Wu Peng, Director-General of the African Affairs Department at China\\'s foreign ministry expressing support via Twitter on Tuesday. Tweet 1 \"The informational asymmetry between creditors – with Eurobond holders in the dark surrounding the extent of indebtedness to China, including the structure and negotiations progress with Beijing – remains a sticky point,\" Irmgard Erasmus, senior financial economist at NKC African Economics, said in a note Wednesday. Tellimer\\'s Curran told CNBC that a key concern for bondholders is that if they sign off on debt relief or restructuring without sufficient clarity on the existing stock of Chinese debt and terms of restructuring, then the cashflow savings will \"simply be funnelled to Chinese creditors.\" \"Zambia last issued a Eurobond in 2015, before debt began to spiral out of control, and most of the runup since then has been related to Chinese-funded infrastructure projects,\" he said. \"From this perspective, bondholders could argue that they shouldn\\'t be responsible for doing the heavy lifting to put debt back on a sustainable trajectory.\"\\n\\nWhat happens if Zambia defaults?\\n\\nIn addition to the October payment obligation of $42.5 million, Zambia faces Eurobond debt servicing costs of $56.1 million in January 2021 and $20.2 million in March 2021, all of which it will be unable to pay. \"Under the strict assumptions that bondholders will insist on complete transparency on public and publicly-guaranteed (PPG) debt, in particular debt contracted by Zesco (Zambia\\'s state utility), we see a high risk of holdouts until restructuring agreements with large Chinese creditors (primarily EximBank) and/or a formal IMF programme have been reached,\" NKC\\'s Erasmus said.',\n",

       "  'text': '(CNN) The country is facing another cycle of the Covid-19 pandemic, and it may be the hardest yet, former Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said Monday.\\n\\n\"I think we\\'re right now at the cusp of what\\'s going to be exponential spread in parts of the country,\" Gottlieb said on CNBC\\'s \"Squawk Box.\"\\n\\n\"If we took aggressive steps right now, we could potentially forestall the worst of it, but we\\'re not going to do that,\" because there\\'s a lot of fatigue and \"policy resistance to taking strong action,\" he said.\\n\\n\"We really have two or three months of the acute phase of this pandemic to get through,\" he said. \"This is going to be the hardest phase, probably.\"\\n\\nWorst number of cases yet\\n\\nThat\\'s as the country continues to report the most number of cases we\\'ve seen to date. The seven-day average of daily new cases reached an all-time high of 68,767 on Sunday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The previous record of 67,293 was set July 22.\\n\\n\"Unfortunately, I think the statement about \\'new record\\' is going to be repeated over and over again in the days and weeks to come,\" said Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health.\\n\\n\"I expect that those numbers will continue to climb. Hospitalizations are going to continue to climb.\"\\n\\nThe abysmal week was marked by the two worst days of daily new cases reported since the pandemic began. More than 83,000 new cases were reported both Friday and Saturday, according to Johns Hopkins.\\n\\nTo be clear: This surge reflects an onslaught of new infections -- not just increased testing, contrary to what skeptics claim.\\n\\n\"You know why we have cases? Because we test so much,\" President Donald Trump claimed at a rally Saturday in North Carolina. \"And in many ways, it\\'s good. And in many ways, it\\'s foolish.\"\\n\\nBut the seven-day average of new Covid-19 cases has soared 23% in the past week, according to Johns Hopkins data. The seven-day average of new tests performed has risen only 2.87% over the past week, according to the Covid Tracking Project.\\n\\nAnd we are long past the point of just urban, heavily populated areas being the only places hit hard. South Dakota\\'s test positivity rate is 23%, the state\\'s health department said Monday. That means of every 100 people tested, 23 have been infected. The World Health Organization in May advised governments not to reopen until test positivity rates were 5% or lower for at least 14 days.\\n\\nStates to receive 36.7 million rapid tests\\n\\nThe federal government is shipping 36.7 million rapid Covid-19 tests, and states should be receiving them by the end of the week, the US Department of Health and Human Services told CNN Monday.\\n\\nThe tests are intended to help states with reopening, according to an HHS news release.\\n\\n\"To protect seniors and to facilitate the continued re-opening of schools, businesses and the economy, the Trump Administration prioritized scaling-up our state and national point of care testing capacity,\" Adm. Dr. Brett Giroir, the department\\'s assistant secretary for health, said in a news release Sunday.\\n\\nPresident Donald Trump last month announced a plan to send 150 million BinaxNOW Covid-19 tests nationally. HHS on Monday confirmed that this week\\'s shipments are part of that total.\\n\\n\"Combining personal responsibility with smart, targeted testing is a proven formula to prevent outbreaks -- but we cannot \\'test our way\\' out of this pandemic,\" Giroir said. \"Public vigilance in adhering to precautionary measures is required -- especially as we clearly see the onset of mitigation fatigue.\"\\n\\nWhat happens when hospitals get overwhelmed\\n\\nSome hospitals are starting to max out because of the new surge. And that\\'s bad news for everyone -- not just those with coronavirus.\\n\\n\"We\\'ve seen what happened earlier in this pandemic, when hospitals become overwhelmed and patients end up not receiving care -- not only patients with coronavirus, but also patients with heart attacks and strokes and were in car accidents,\" emergency medicine physician Dr. Leana Wen said.\\n\\nIn Utah, for example, hospitals could be days away from using a patient\\'s age, health and other factors to decide who can stay in crowded intensive care units , and who can\\'t.\\n\\n\"That potentially could be occurring all over the country as our hospitals become overwhelmed,\" Wen said. \"And unlike last time, where it was only certain parts of the country that were experiencing this, now we have virus hotspots that are occurring everywhere.\"\\n\\nAs of Monday, at least 37 states had growing numbers of new Covid-19 cases this past week compared with the previous week, according to Johns Hopkins data. Thirteen states were holding roughly steady, and no state had Covid-19 decreases of at least 10%.\\n\\nMore than 8.6 million people have been infected with coronavirus in the US, and more than 225,000 have died.\\n\\nWe have \\'a narrow window of opportunity right now\\'\\n\\nYes, the dreaded fall surge is spreading across the country. But if we act quickly, we can prevent it from turning into a catastrophic winter surge, doctors say.\\n\\n\"This is not inevitable. We actually have a narrow window of opportunity right now to stop the explosive spread that is coming,\" Wen said Monday.\\n\\n\"But we have this window to take action now. That includes things like national mask mandates, that includes other targeted policies. This is not an all-or-nothing,\" she said.\\n\\n\"President Trump tends to frame this as either we shut down completely, or we literally do nothing. Actually, there\\'s a lot that we can do that will both save lives and also keep our economy going. We should implement those policies now.\"\\n\\nIn Illinois, \"there seems to be a Covid storm on the rise, and we have to get prepared,\" Gov. J.B. Pritzker warned Monday, announcing some restrictions starting for some regions in the state starting Wednesday.\\n\\nIn Idaho, Gov. Brad Little announced Monday he is moving the state back to a more restrictive phase.\\n\\nAnd in Kentucky, a health official expressed concern about a third escalation of the virus that is starting at a higher level of infections than the first two.\\n\\n\"We\\'re running a lot hotter now. It\\'s like the popcorn is popping in the microwave at full intensity, and if we launch from here, this is where we get in trouble real fast,\" Dr. Steven Stack, commissioner of the Kentucky Department for Public Health, said at a news conference Monday.\\n\\nA national mask mandate could help keep businesses open\\n\\nA growing number of officials from across party lines are calling for a nationwide mask mandate.\\n\\nGottlieb, a former FDA head appointed by Trump, wrote an op-ed for The Wall Street Journal titled \"Winter Is Coming: Time for a Mask Mandate.\"\\n\\n\"A mandate can be expressly limited to the next two months,\" Gottlieb wrote, adding that it\\'s easier to wear a mask in the winter than the summer.\\n\\n\"The inconvenience would allow the country to preserve health-care capacity and keep more schools and businesses open.\"\\n\\nAndy Slavitt, former acting chief of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, agreed with Gottlieb on a mask mandate.\\n\\n\"Scott Gottlieb was a Republican. This is not a partisan issue,\" said Slavitt, who served in the Obama administration.\\n\\n\"This is an issue for everyone\\'s public health, and will slow down the spread of the disease.\"\\n\\nIf 95% of Americans wore masks in public, more than 100,000 lives could be saved in the United States through February, according to data released Friday by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington.\\n\\n\"If people are not wearing masks, then maybe we should be mandating it,\" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\\n\\nGottlieb wrote that mask mandates have become divisive only because of the way some politicians and political commentators have framed the issue.\\n\\n\"States should be able to choose how to enforce a mandate,\" he wrote, \"but the goal should be to make masks a social and cultural norm, not a political statement.\"',\n",

Wheeler is an assistant professor of pathology, microbiology and immunology at Vanderbilt and one of the principal investigators of a convalescent plasma trial at Vanderbilt that was launched with Ms. Parton’s funding. Through a $34 million National Institutes of Health grant, that research was later expanded to 51 additional sites around the country. The team’s goal is to treat 500 patients with convalescent plasma and 500 others with a placebo.\\n\\n“I am overwhelmed by the donor response to our study,” Dr. Wheeler said. “This has been a hard year for everybody, and seeing how much people really want to help has been a high point for me. But blood is a limited resource. At this time, we absolutely couldn’t give convalescent plasma to everyone who may benefit. We just wouldn’t have enough plasma.”\\n\\nEnter The Rock.\\n\\nThe wrestler-turned-movie-star otherwise known as Dwayne Johnson has stepped up to be a spokesman for a public-private initiative called “The Fight Is in Us.” Mr. Johnson encourages Covid-19 survivors to donate plasma: “If you survived it, then you’re the heroes we need,” he says in a P.S.A. “You fought for your life. Now, let’s work together to take down Covid-19.”\\n\\nThe Food and Drug Administration has not yet approved convalescent plasma as a treatment for Covid-19, but it does allow emergency use in life-threatening cases. Creating a stockpile of convalescent plasma would make it possible to treat many more severely ill patients during resurgences of the virus before a vaccine is widely available. (Donating is possible all over the country. Click here to find out how.)\\n\\nA caveat: Though the early evidence suggests that Covid reinfections are exceedingly rare, at least within this first year of the pandemic, it is far too soon to believe that surviving the virus means you are safe. You still need to avoid large gatherings. You still need to keep your distance from people outside your immediate household. You still need to wear a mask.\\n\\nBut being a survivor means you can help. Donating plasma takes a couple of hours, and it’s no more painful than a needle stick. Your own body will replenish the plasma within a day or two, antibodies included.\\n\\nAt my last donation, I watched a friend’s small, socially-distanced wedding on Zoom while I was connected to the apheresis machine, which was collecting my blood and sorting it into parts — plasma, platelets, white blood cells and red blood cells.

I held my phone with one hand, and I squeezed a ball with the other, helping the blood move through the machine more quickly. I watched my friends promise to love each other through good times and bad, in sickness and in health, and I prayed for their health.

Last week, that number jumped to more than 8,000.\\n\\nThe state\\'s Democratic governor, Jared Polis, warns that the situation could worsen in the coming months.\\n\\n\"We just have this short window of time to get this back under control before the holiday season, and we need to do it,\" he told reporters last week. \"Every one of us needs to really ask ourselves what is our resolve to avoid unnecessary loss of life.\"\\n\\nIn July, Polis implemented a mask requirement for public indoor spaces that\\'s in force until Nov. 10. On Friday the health department limited social gatherings to 10 people or fewer from no more than two households.\\n\\n\"If people do need to feel the need to socialize, we totally understand that,\" he says during an interview on NPR\\'s All Things Considered. \"But not a neighborhood block party, not three or four different households. No more than two households.\"\\n\\nPolis discusses the challenges he faces as the state tries to contain the escalation of community spread.\\n\\nThe mask mandate expires in a couple of weeks. Are you likely to renew?\\n\\nWe obviously evaluate it based on the data where we are at any given time with regard to the end date of that. But certainly where we are today, that\\'s critical. It\\'s a critical tool to help contain the spread.\\n\\nTwo Denver area churches have filed suit against the state challenging [the mask and social gathering orders]. They won. How do you manage the growing number of infections in your state when you have lawsuits trying to prevent you from enacting protections?\\n\\nWell, it should really be about people wanting to do the right thing. I was so thrilled to see several Episcopal and other bishops supporting mask wearing among their members and their congregation. We\\'ve seen so many institutions of faith go online, limit their attendance. I think certainly a lot of faith leaders care deeply about the lives of their congregants and understand that we\\'ll be able to rejoice and fellowship in person again in the not too distant future. But that we\\'re not there yet.\\n\\nThere have been a worrying number of outbreaks at Colorado schools. ... The Colorado chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics is warning in-person school is becoming less feasible because community spread is increasing. What do you do about that? Are you prepared, for example, to dial back in-person teaching?\\n\\nMost of our schools are back in Colorado. They have guidance they need to follow. But then, you know, some of them, whether they\\'re back two days a week or five days a week is locally driven. We have found, across the board, that schools have been as safe or safer than other things kids might be doing, primarily because they\\'re structured and there is the ability to implement strong health guidelines like mask wearing, which is required for all students across our state in class, as well as the teacher.\\n\\nIn your state and many others, you have a mask mandate in place. You\\'re saying you\\'ll look at whether you renew it. You\\'ve got a new health order limiting the size of crowds. ... But is that enough, given winter is coming, the holidays are upon us and the numbers are going in the wrong way?\\n\\nSo, you know, in Colorado, weather is a factor in winter. ... People do tend to congregate in larger indoor areas in winter than they do when the weather is nice. And so it\\'s really making sure that, to the extent people want to engage in these activities, like dining, for example, we have the capacity restrictions around restaurants to make sure that there\\'s sufficient social distancing and the wait staff and others in the kitchen are all wearing masks as well.\\n\\nChristopher Intagliata and Gus Contreras edited and produced the audio interview.

The industrial giant is now on track to produce 2 billion N95 masks this year, about half of which will be in the United States, according to Roman.\\n\\nEven so, shortages of personal protective equipment for health-care workers, including masks, have remained present during the pandemic. The issue is taking on renewed salience in the U.S. now as hospitalizations from Covid-19 are rising in 36 states.\\n\\nPublic health experts have stressed the importance of people wearing face coverings to slow transmission of the virus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the general public should not wear N95s in order to reserve the supply for health-care workers and first responders. Instead, the agency recommends people wear cloth face coverings.\\n\\nIn March, as the Covid-19 outbreak in the U.S. was worsening, some retailers were criticized for having N95 masks on their shelves. Roman acknowledged there is \"strong consumer demand\" for the respirator masks due to their reputation of being highly effective.\\n\\nBut he said 3M continues to direct its new supply toward hospital workers and other medical professionals. The company also is working alongside the Department of Health and Human Services to \"make sure we\\'re focused on the hot spots,\" Roman said.\\n\\n\"That still is the priority,\" he added. \"We\\'ll continue to look for ways to support consumers, and our consumer teams are looking at innovative, new mask kinds of solutions in addition to the N95 respirators, so we\\'ll work to respond to that, as well.\"\\n\\n3M also has filed more than a dozen lawsuits in response to fraudulent N95 masks and price gouging during the health crisis.

We\\'ve now followed through on that, and we\\'ve added that capacity to be stepping into what we saw as a potential for a second wave of Covid cases,\" he said.\\n\\n\"And we followed through on the commitment to bring over 200 million respirators in from production overseas into the U.S. because of the demand here, so we have found ways to react,\" he added.',\n",

Zambia\\'s confirmed COVID-19 cases have continued rising, with the total number close to the 10,000 mark. Xinhua/Martin Mbangweta via Getty Images\\n\\nZambia has three weeks to improve transparency over its debt obligations and make progress toward an IMF-backed reform package, or risk defaulting on its loans. Last week, a meeting of creditors was adjourned until Nov. 13 after a consortium comprising around 40% of Zambia\\'s Eurobond holders opted to abstain from voting on the country\\'s debt relief proposals, rather than voting them down. Experts suggest bondholders are hoping the government can offer more clarity on its debt, particularly to China, and demonstrate progress toward an IMF program ahead of the Nov. 13 meeting. \"However, if no progress is made then there is no reason to suspect that bondholders will soften their stance, which will push Zambia into default when its grace period expires on 13 November and will signal a potentially acrimonious restructuring process ahead,\" said Patrick Curran, senior economist at emerging markets consultancy Tellimer. S&P Global Ratings on Thursday downgraded Zambia\\'s foreign currency rating to \"selective default.\" \"We view the nonpayment of debt service and the statement that the government will not make debt service payments as a default on its commercial debt obligations,\" the ratings agency said in its update, forecasting that Zambia will remain in payment default for \"at least the six months of the standstill period\" as the government works toward debt restructuring.\\n\\nHow did Zambia get here?\\n\\nOn Oct. 13, the Zambian government announced it would suspend debt service payments to external commercial creditors, citing liquidity challenges compounded by the coronavirus pandemic. It has since failed to make an interest payment due on Oct. 14 for its 2024 Eurobond. Eurobonds are debt instruments denominated in any currency other than that of the issuer. The government had on Sept. 22 asked Eurobond holders to agree to a temporary debt repayment freeze. However, Zambia\\'s problems long predate the coronavirus crisis, with its economy constrained by structural factors such as low wealth, high fiscal deficits and a heavy debt burden.\\n\\nLUSAKA, ZAMBIA - November 20: Edgar Chagwa Lungu, President of Zambia, on November 20, 2015 in Lusaka, Zambia. Thomas Trutschel/Photothek via Getty Images\\n\\nTellimer\\'s Curran told CNBC that these issues had been compounded by \"excessively lax fiscal policy\" since President Edgar Lungu came to power in 2015. \"Over this period the budget deficit has averaged nearly 8% of GDP, driven mainly by a massive pipeline of Chinese-backed infrastructure projects,\" he continued. \"With most debt denominated in dollars, sharp kwacha depreciation has exacerbated Zambia\\'s fiscal problems and pushed debt from around 36% of GDP in 2014 to 92% by the of 2019.\" While an IMF-backed reform package has been repeatedly promised by the government, it has consistently balked at austerity measures, and Curran said the country\\'s credibility has been \"squandered\" with the IMF and creditors.\\n\\nTransparency and Chinese debt\\n\\nGiven Zambia\\'s pre-existing vulnerabilities, Curran suggested it should not be used as a bellwether for other African sovereigns post-Covid, but he said its restructuring effort could offer important lessons for other nations seeking bilateral debt relief. In particular, the government\\'s seeking of private sector involvement is a first among countries included in the World Bank\\'s Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI).\\n\\nBEIJING, CHINA - MARCH 30: Chinese Premier Li Keqiang (2nd-R) meets Zambia\\'s President Edgar Chagwa Lungu (2nd-L) at the Great Hall of the People on March 30, 2015 in Beijing, China. Feng Li-Pool/Getty Images\\n\\nThe key issue for bondholders remains a lack of clarity on the size, composition and terms of Chinese funding and assurances that an IMF program is imminent. Although clearly problematic for Eurobond creditors, Zambia\\'s decision to skip payment seems to have found favor with Beijing, with Wu Peng, Director-General of the African Affairs Department at China\\'s foreign ministry expressing support via Twitter on Tuesday. Tweet 1 \"The informational asymmetry between creditors – with Eurobond holders in the dark surrounding the extent of indebtedness to China, including the structure and negotiations progress with Beijing – remains a sticky point,\" Irmgard Erasmus, senior financial economist at NKC African Economics, said in a note Wednesday. Tellimer\\'s Curran told CNBC that a key concern for bondholders is that if they sign off on debt relief or restructuring without sufficient clarity on the existing stock of Chinese debt and terms of restructuring, then the cashflow savings will \"simply be funnelled to Chinese creditors.\" \"Zambia last issued a Eurobond in 2015, before debt began to spiral out of control, and most of the runup since then has been related to Chinese-funded infrastructure projects,\" he said. \"From this perspective, bondholders could argue that they shouldn\\'t be responsible for doing the heavy lifting to put debt back on a sustainable trajectory.\"\\n\\nWhat happens if Zambia defaults?\\n\\nIn addition to the October payment obligation of $42.5 million, Zambia faces Eurobond debt servicing costs of $56.1 million in January 2021 and $20.2 million in March 2021, all of which it will be unable to pay. \"Under the strict assumptions that bondholders will insist on complete transparency on public and publicly-guaranteed (PPG) debt, in particular debt contracted by Zesco (Zambia\\'s state utility), we see a high risk of holdouts until restructuring agreements with large Chinese creditors (primarily EximBank) and/or a formal IMF programme have been reached,\" NKC\\'s Erasmus said.',\n",

At the beginning of the study, in June, 6% of those who took the tests had IgG antibody responses to the coronavirus, they reported. By September, just 4.4% of them did. For health care workers, the rates stayed about the same.\\n\\nAntibodies are the proteins your body naturally generates to fight infection. IgG are one type -- the tests were not designed to detect other types of antibodies. Other research teams have found that other types of antibodies may persist longer than IgG does.\\n\\nThe results also confirm earlier studies that showed that people who did not have symptoms of Covid-19 are likely to lose detectable antibodies sooner rather than those who had more severe infections.\\n\\nRead the full story:',\n",

       "  'text': 'Moscow (CNN) In August, Russian state media rolled out the red carpet for a bombshell announcement -- President Vladimir Putin, from his residence outside Moscow, unveiled what he said was the world\\'s first registered coronavirus vaccine , meant to bring Russia closer to the end of a devastating pandemic.\\n\\nPutin, who is famously secretive about his family, said one of his daughters had already been inoculated as part of the early-stage trials and felt \"well,\" to bulk up the vaccine\\'s safety claims.\\n\\nNow, as the second wave of Covid-19 hits the country -- with record numbers of new infections and deaths -- the vaccine, named Sputnik V , is far from being widely available to the general public.\\n\\nRussia has passed a grim milestone of 1.5 million cases and at least 26,269 deaths, although experts have previously cast doubts on Russia\\'s counting methods.\\n\\nLagging in trials\\n\\nRussia approved the vaccine after trying it on several dozen subjects in a non-blind study and ahead of Phase 3 trials, which are key to establish its safety and efficacy, drawing skepticism from the international community and accusations it could have jumped the gun for political gains.\\n\\nAlexander Gintsburg, head of the Gamaleya Institute which developed the vaccine, told CNN in an exclusive interview last week at Valdai Discussion Club, a Moscow-based think tank where Putin often makes an appearance, that 17,000 people took part in the Phase 3 trials but acknowledged that only 6,000 so far have received both doses necessary to complete the vaccination.\\n\\nThe vaccine is indicated for use in people age 18-60, according to its instructions, since no large-scale trials on other age groups have been conducted. But despite this, Gintsburg said people over 60 can still take it.\\n\\nInternational virology experts cast doubt on Russia\\'s claims of proven safety. \"People who were immunized with this vaccine won\\'t know whether they will be protected or develop a severe disease until they encounter the virus,\" Konstantin Chumakov, a top virologist with the Global Virus Network, told CNN in an interview.\\n\\n\"And to do this, you need to immunize a whole lot of people and just wait until they will be infected and see whether they will have a lower incidence or they will have more severe disease. There is just nothing that can replace clinical trials.\"\\n\\nBy comparison, as of October 26, BioNTech-Pfizer reported that it had enrolled 42,113 participants out of a prospective 44,000 in the Phase 3 trial in the United States for their vaccine candidate, with 35,771 people having received their second doses.\\n\\nModerna, the first company to start US Phase 3 clinical trials of a Covid-19 vaccine, said Thursday that 25,650 people have received their second shot out of around 30,000 enrolled participants.\\n\\nThe Russian vaccine \"is probably two to three months behind,\" Chumakov said. \"Moderna and Pfizer basically finished enrolling the patients and now they\\'re in the observation phase looking at the incidence of disease in placebo and immunized individuals.\"\\n\\nThe speedy development and approval of Sputnik V, the Gamaleya Institute explains, was possible as it is based on two of their previous developments, vaccines for Ebola and MERS, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. The Ebola vaccine, Gintsburg previously said, was approved for trials in Guinea on just 2,000 people.\\n\\nChumakov notes that neither of these vaccines has been fully authorized by international bodies or tested enough to say it is effective and safe, and the Russian Ebola vaccine was tried in Guinea only post-outbreak.\\n\\n\"This particular institute, they have developed several prototype vaccines, I wouldn\\'t call them vaccines,\" Chumakov said. \"I don\\'t think that this institute has developed a vaccine in the last, you know, 30 years. They are very good in developing prototypes ... but I don\\'t believe they have any experience in bringing products to the market.\"\\n\\nProduction challenges\\n\\nRussia\\'s own estimates of their capability to mass-produce the vaccine vary greatly depending on whom you ask.\\n\\nIn July, the head of Russia Direct Investment Fund Kirill Dmitriev said the sovereign wealth fund plans to produce more than 30 million doses by end of 2020 . But Russia\\'s trade and industry minister Denis Manturov said earlier this month these numbers are \"impossible.\"\\n\\n\"To have 30 million doses by year-end is impossible, it is nonsense,\" Manturov said in an interview with Bloomberg TV\\n\\nThe Ministry of Industry and Trade did not provide CNN with the exact figure of how many doses have been made so far but said the goal was to scale up production to 300,000 doses by the end of October and 2.3 million by the end of the year.\\n\\nGintsburg told CNN Russia could produce around 5 million a month by December, which he said would allow getting enough doses to vaccinate 70% of the Russian population in about a year.\\n\\nBut unless Russia ramps up the production significantly from 5 million doses a month, the country will be only able produce around 60 million doses in this time frame, meaning it would be able to effectively vaccinate about 30 million people with both doses — out of more than 146 million Russians.\\n\\nWhether Russia will be able to scale up the production to meet the latest goals remains questionable, but more sites are preparing to go online to produce Sputnik V in the next weeks while Phase 3 trials are ongoing.\\n\\nAll Russian regions have received pilot batches of Sputnik V, the Ministry of Health said at the end of September. But at least 10 regions reported the first supply to be relatively small, between 42 and 44 doses, according to a CNN tally based on statements from health officials and media reports.\\n\\nAuthorities in the Yamal-Nenets region, which received 42 doses of the vaccine, said in a statement to TASS the delivery is complicated by \"special temperature conditions during transportation and storage.\"\\n\\nMost coronavirus vaccine front-runners require storage at deep-freeze temperatures, imposing additional challenges on governments to set up functioning supply chains. The Pfizer vaccine must be stored at -70 °C (-94 °F), while Moderna vaccine requires storage at -20 °C (-4 °F) and Sputnik V at -18 °C (-0.4 °F).\\n\\nJUST WATCHED CNN gets exclusive access inside secretive Russian lab Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH CNN gets exclusive access inside secretive Russian lab 03:03\\n\\n\"I have a whole lot of respect to them as scientists but unfortunately they probably don\\'t appreciate the scale of issues that they will be facing to bring this product to the market,\" Chumakov said.\\n\\n\"There is a huge distance between the experimental sample that can be prepared in the lab and bringing it to the mass production and distribution,\" he added. \"I think that\\'s a very cavalier attitude that, OK, we\\'ve just synthesized it in two weeks and here we go, we have a vaccine. They have a prototype. And until it\\'s tested, it still remains a prototype.\"\\n\\nPR frenzy\\n\\nWhat Sputnik V lacks in participants and data, it has compensated for in PR.\\n\\nDespite Phase 3 trial being in early stages, high-ranking Russian officials made public announcements about their vaccination in meetings with Putin. State TV ran clips of Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu taking the shot in one of the clinics. In early October, Putin announced that dozens of his relatives and staffers working around him got vaccinated.\\n\\nPutin did not specify which of his daughters took the vaccine as he rarely calls them by name, even referring to them as \"these women\" when asked last year about their businesses in Russia. Alexey Venediktov, a well-connected editor-in-chief of radio station Echo of Moscow, said Katerina Tikhonova, widely believed to be Putin\\'s youngest daughter, was the one who got the shot in early-stage trials.\\n\\nGintsburg previously told CNN the Gamaleya Institute did not receive any instructions and has no \"links to the Kremlin,\" dismissing a suggestion there was political pressure to speed the production of vaccine.\\n\\nTikhonova heads the organization Innopraktika, which says its mission is to bring scientific developments into the business world and boasts a long list of heads of Russia\\'s key state enterprises like Gazprom, Rosatom and Transneft as members of the board. RDIF\\'s Kirill Dmitriev is also a board member, and his wife, Natalia Popova, is the deputy director of Innopraktika.\\n\\nPopova told state TV she was able to see \"how the vaccine was born in closed labs of Gamaleya Institute\" and was among the first people to receive Sputnik V, even ahead of her husband.\\n\\nJUST WATCHED CNN anchor questions Russian CEO about vaccine transparency Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH CNN anchor questions Russian CEO about vaccine transparency 07:39\\n\\nRussian officials and state media also promoted Sputnik V as superior to some other Western vaccines. RDIF repeatedly said its drug is \"based on a well-studied human adenoviral vectors platform with proven safety and efficacy\" unlike those based on mRNA and chimpanzee adenovirus, such as the UK\\'s AstraZeneca vaccine.\\n\\nEarlier this month, British officials slammed Russia for what they believe is a disinformation campaign against the AstraZeneca vaccine, dubbed \"monkey vaccine\" by some Russians, following a flurry of social media posts with baseless memes suggesting the drug could turn people into monkeys.\\n\\nKremlin denied the allegations and RDIF said it condemns social media posts attacking the vaccine. RDIF\\'s portfolio company R-Pharm also signed a deal with AstraZeneca this summer to produce the British vaccine in Russia.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t think that this vaccine is any better or worse than other similar products because there are many adenovirus-based vaccines in development right now and they\\'re being tested. So this one is probably OK -- but we need to have data and we don\\'t have it yet,\" Chumakov said, adding that although some vaccines are close to obtaining a license, there is no fully authorized and widely used adenovirus vaccine to date.\\n\\nEconomic boost\\n\\nAside from scoring PR victories, Russia is aiming for economic gains.\\n\\nLast week Putin told the leaders of the RSPP or the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, Russia\\'s biggest business lobby, that Sputnik V was \"good business and the humanitarian component is clear,\" adding that it could earn $100 billion in revenue worldwide, state-run news agency RIA Novosti reported.\\n\\nRDIF announced it had reached deals with several countries, including India, Brazil and Egypt, to supply millions of doses of Sputnik V. But the fund might face licensing difficulties in trying to expand Sputnik production globally due to different standards.\\n\\n\"I think that in the United States, in Europe, in countries that really adhere to the international rules of product development, testing and licensure, this would not fly, it\\'s definitely a gamble,\" Chumakov said.\\n\\nNevertheless, the country\\'s officials say they plan to roll out mass vaccination in the coming months, even though state polls show the majority of Russians do not want to get the vaccine.\\n\\nOne Russian who isn\\'t taking the Sputnik V vaccine so far is the President, with his spokesman telling CNN that he is still thinking about it.',\n",

       "  'text': '(CNN) As the weather gets colder and we face the double threat of the flu and a surge in Covid-19 cases , now is a prime opportunity to stock up on food and supplies.\\n\\nCovid-19 cases will likely increase in the winter months for three reasons: \"First, the virus that causes Covid-19 is a coronavirus and other coronaviruses spread more in winter months,\" said CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen.\\n\\nSeniors shop at Northgate Gonzalez Market on March 19 in Los Angeles. Storing extra groceries and other items is an important step in slowing the spread of the coronavirus.\\n\\n\"Second, in winter months, the air is less humid. Particles that carry the virus can linger in the air for longer. Also, our nasal membranes are drier and more vulnerable to infection.\"\\n\\nAdditionally, as the weather gets colder, people will spend more time indoors, where the virus has an easier ability to spread given the lack of adequate ventilation that would diffuse virus particles. \"All of this is why we need to stay extra vigilant in the winter months,\" added Wen, who is an emergency physician and a visiting professor at George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health.\\n\\nIn addition to following safety guidance, part of that vigilance includes having the right kinds and amounts of foods and medical supplies stocked up to limit trips to stores.\\n\\n\"Any winter season can bring storms, power outages, delays in shipping of critical items to local or from online stores so knowing that you have all the provisions you need to manage these potential events is critical,\" said Susan L. Polan, the associate executive director of public affairs and advocacy at the American Public Health Association, via email.\\n\\n\"COVID-19 surges and the flu can make trying to buy supplies harder — or riskier, if you or your family members are sick. You are going to want to do everything to make sure you and your loved ones are safe.\"\\n\\nHere\\'s what you need to have on hand in your pantry, freezer, medicine cabinet and more to limit errands and in case of sickness, quarantine or disaster this season.\\n\\nHousehold cleaning and protection\\n\\nFor regular hand hygiene and after receiving deliveries, checking your mail or shopping, you need soap and hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends\\n\\nIf you have sick roommates or family members, wipes and disinfectant are necessary for frequently touched surfaces like kitchen counters and doorknobs.

Keep adhesive bandages stocked for wounds.\\n\\nIf you have a condition, \"periodically check your regular prescription drugs to ensure a continuous supply in your home,\" suggests Ready, a national US public service campaign for emergency preparedness. A seven- to 10-day supply stored in childproof containers should suffice.\\n\\nIn the case of an emergency, having on hand print or electronic health records could be helpful so \"you are not scrambling as you are trying to leave your house,\" Polan said.\\n\\nCovid-19 and flu, so have a thermometer on hand for checking your temperature if you\\'re feeling warm. Fever is a symptom of bothCovid-19 and flu, so have a thermometer on hand for checking your temperature if you\\'re feeling warm. Denture and contact lens supplies , hearing aid batteries and feminine hygiene and baby supplies are necessary if applicable.\\n\\nAnd \"get your flu shot,\" Polan said. \"It is the best way to avoid getting the flu and it is important to reduce the impact on an already overburdened health care system.\"\\n\\nLong-lasting food and snacks\\n\\nThere is no need to empty the shelves at your local grocery store, but you can store a little extra to limit trips to the supermarket and have food on hand in case you have to quarantine. Store a two-week supply of water and foods that are nonperishable, easy to prepare and in accordance with any food allergies or limitations.\\n\\nCanned beans, legumes and fish are filling, nutrient-rich sources of protein and omega-3 fatty acids. Nut butters are full of healthy fats and pair well with many foods. Whole-grain and bean pastas, oats and grains are hearty staples.\\n\\nCanned soups, high-fiber cereals and protein bars are quick meals and snacks. Stock up on canned and frozen vegetables and fruits, and jarred or canned sauces as well. And don\\'t forget the snacks: Dried fruits are rich sources of iron, fiber and antioxidants; nuts can be good sources of calcium and vitamin E.\\n\\nFor hydration, store at least 1 gallon of water per person per day. If you enjoy dairy or plant-based milks or coffee, purchase shelf-stable milks and coffee grounds. Animal proteins, hard cheeses and breads can be frozen.\\n\\nA disaster preparedness kit\\n\\nHaving an emergency preparedness stockpile is \"always good to have... because you don\\'t know when disaster is going to strike,\" said Lori Tremmel Freeman, the CEO of the National Association of County and City Health Officials.

       "  'text': '(CNN) Wisconsin\\'s governor on Tuesday warned of an impending crisis as the state continues to see coronavirus cases rise and its hospitals overwhelmed.\\n\\n\"There is no way to sugarcoat it, we are facing an urgent crisis and there is an imminent risk to you and your family,\" Gov. Tony Evers said.\\n\\nHospital beds in the state are 84% full, as well as 87% of intensive care unit beds, according to state data, as hospitalizations continue to escalate.\\n\\nThe state opened a hospital facility at the state fair grounds October 14, and five patients have been cared for there as of Tuesday.\\n\\nMore than 5,000 confirmed cases were reported in Wisconsin as of Tuesday, bringing the total number there to more than 200,000 -- a \"tragic\" and \"concerning\" milestone, Evers said. The state\\'s death toll rose by 64 Tuesday, bringing the total to 1,852.\\n\\n\"The increasing cases, and our increase in deaths today are the largest single day increases we\\'ve seen throughout the course of this pandemic,\" said Andrea Palm, Secretary-designee of Wisconsin\\'s Department of Health Services. \"We must take significant and collective action.\"\\n\\nThe state\\'s seven-day average of new cases has increased by more than 400%, Palm said. It took seven months for cases to reach 100,000 there, and only 36 days to hit 200,000 Evers said.\\n\\nEvers\\' warning comes as nearly half a million Americans tested positive for Covid-19 in just the last week as a fall surge of the contagious virus claws its way into every region of the country.\\n\\nMore than 8.7 million in US infected since pandemic began\\n\\nThe past seven days have been marked by daunting coronavirus records and upticks, with 489,769 new cases reported since October 20.\\n\\nIn the US, more than 8.7 million people have now been infected since the pandemic began, according to Johns Hopkins University.\\n\\nThe fall resurgence has led some local and state officials to rein in their reopening plans, as hospitalization numbers increase and states report case records. Still, public fatigue and political unwillingness to require masks and restrict gatherings -- exemplified by the White House chief of staff\\'s frank admission that \" we are not going to control the pandemic \" -- suggest worse days to come.\\n\\nDr. Scott Gottlieb, former commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration, said on CNBC\\'s \"Squawk Box\" on Monday that the US was at a tipping point, where aggressive action could stem the worst of the pandemic.\\n\\n\"But we\\'re not going to do that and I understand why. There\\'s a lot of fatigue set in and a lot of policy resistance to taking strong action ahead of, you know, the spread,\" he said.\\n\\n\"I think we\\'re right now at the cusp of what\\'s going to be exponential spread in parts of the country.\"\\n\\nAt 69,967 new cases per day, the 7-day average of new cases is at the highest levels since the pandemic began, bringing the national death toll to 226,524, according to data from Johns Hopkins.\\n\\nIf the current trend continues, the US could see 100,000 new cases per day, Dr. Ashish Jha, the dean of Brown University School of Public Health, said Tuesday.\\n\\nLike Gottlieb, Jha said that could be avoided, but \"there\\'s just not enough policy impetus to act as we need to, and I\\'m worried we\\'re going to hit 100,000 in a day at some point in the coming weeks,\" Jha said.\\n\\nAnd state numbers are worrisome too: 37 states are reporting at least 10% more new cases in the past week compared to the previous week, and 21 states saw their highest 7-day averages on Sunday.\\n\\nIn all, 29 states have reported at least one record high day of new cases during the month of October, according to Johns Hopkins University data.\\n\\nThe increase in cases is not because of more testing but because of more infections, said Admiral Brett Giroir, the White House coronavirus task force testing czar, a position contrary to President Trump\\'s comments.\\n\\n\"Testing may be identifying some more cases, I think that\\'s clearly true, but what we\\'re seeing is a real increase in the numbers,\" Giroir said Tuesday during a Washington Post live event.\\n\\nPublic health measures like mask wearing, avoiding crowds, physical distancing and hand hygiene make a difference, as they did in Arizona, Florida, Texas and across the Deep South, he said.\\n\\nSome officials reinstate restrictions\\n\\nOfficials from New Jersey to Denver to Idaho are responding to the bad news by rolling back reopening plans.\\n\\nWith 1,223 new cases and 948 hospitalizations on Monday, New Jersey is experiencing a spike, Gov. Phil Murphy said.\\n\\nNewark, which is in the counties with the top five case counts, will begin implementing restrictions including closing non-essential businesses by 8 p.m. starting Tuesday, according to a press release.\\n\\n\"This is not the first time COVID-19 has threatened our city and its residents at this magnitude and once again, we will meet this challenge with determination and guided by data,\" said Newark Mayor Ras Baraka in the statement.\\n\\nIn Massachusetts, 13 communities are rolling back their reopening plans as well after the state reported more than 1,000 new cases for three days in a row.\\n\\nThe communities are going back to step one of Phase 3 of the state\\'s plan, which closes many indoor recreation businesses, reduces occupancy in establishments like gyms and museums to 40%, restricts outdoor gatherings at event venues to 50 people and reduces outdoor performances to 25% capacity.\\n\\nIn Idaho, even though Gov. Brad Little said the economy will remain open, the state moved back from Stage 4 of the reopening plan to Stage 3.\\n\\n\"It doesn\\'t mean in-person church will end. It doesn\\'t mean we\\'re restricting travel in or out of the state,\" he added. \"It especially doesn\\'t mean that we should go to for remote learning in our schools.\"\\n\\nYet other states have resisted taking more serious restrictions or requiring people to wear masks, which are proven to limit the spread of the virus.\\n\\nFor example, Dr. Deborah Birx of the White House coronavirus task force lambasted mask usage in North Dakota during a stop in Bismarck Monday.\\n\\n\"Over the last 24 hours as we were here and we were in your grocery stores and in your restaurants, and frankly even in your hotels, this is the least use of masks that we have we seen in retail establishments of any place we have been,\" Birx told local reporters, according to the Bismarck Tribune. \"And we find that deeply unfortunate because you don\\'t know who\\'s infected and you don\\'t know if you\\'re infected yourself.\"\\n\\nThere is not currently a mask mandate in North Dakota -- one of 15 states without such policy. The state has the highest rate of infections per 100,000 people, according to Johns Hopkins University data.\\n\\nHalloween plans change as infections rise in children\\n\\nAs coronavirus cases rise across the nation, the impact on children has grown.\\n\\nOver the past two weeks, the amount of cases among children has increased by 14%, The American Academy of Pediatrics said Monday.\\n\\nThe group, which represents pediatricians, says about 792,188 children have been infected in the US as of October 22. And the AAP said 94,555 new cases among children 17 and under were reported from October 8 to October 22.\\n\\nTo stay safe and prevent infection, children may not be able to celebrate Halloween the way they are used to this year, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said\\n\\n\"There are lots of ways to celebrate the spooky season that are safer than traditional activities,\" Dr. Michael St. Louis of CDC\\'s Community Guidance Team said on a call with community leaders.\\n\\nOptions include virtual costume parties, scavenger hunts for candy, small outdoor and distanced gatherings and one-way trick or treating, where candy is placed at the end of the driveway for children to collect, he said.\\n\\nPeople may have to find creative ways to incorporate face masks into their costume this year, St. Louis noted.\\n\\n\"It\\'s important to understand that a costume mask is not a substitute for a cloth face mask, unless it has two or more layers of breathable fabric and fits snugly around the nose, mouth and under the chin,\" he said.',\n",

       "  'text': 'ROME (AP) — Pope Francis‘ decision to forgo wearing a mask has been noticed, with some concern, by the commission of Vatican experts he appointed to help chart the Catholic Church’s path through the coronavirus pandemic and the aftermath.\\n\\nThe Rev. Augusto Zampini, one of the key members of the pope’s COVID-19 commission, acknowledged Tuesday that at age 83 and with part of his lung removed after an illness in his youth, Francis would be at high risk for complications if he were to become infected with COVID-19.\\n\\n“He has started to use the mask now,” Zampini said in response to reporters’ questions. “And I hope he will use it in the general audiences, when he is close to the people. If you’re in an open space, we know that it’s different. But well, we are working on that.”\\n\\nFrancis has courted some criticism for declining to wear a mask when indoors, even though Vatican regulations call for masks indoors and out when social distancing cannot be guaranteed. While Francis‘ lung condition could help explain his decision to forego the mask, he donned one for more than two hours last week when he presided over an indoor and outdoor interreligious prayer service in downtown Rome.\\n\\nYet the following day, Francis went maskless during his indoor general audience in the Vatican auditorium, including when he shook hands with a handful of similarly maskless bishops and leaned in to speak privately to each one. On Saturday, he met with Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez, who arrived wearing a mask only to take it off for the audience in the pope’s library.\\n\\nPhotos of the maskless leaders caused a mild stir in Spain over the weekend, but the prime minister’s office dismissed it by saying the delegation was following Vatican protocol rules. Spain last week became the first country in Western Europe with more than 1 million confirmed virus cases.\\n\\nThe Vatican has declined to respond to questions about Francis and masks.\\n\\nZampini said the recent rise in infections in the tiny city state have commission members and the Vatican as a whole concerned. Thirteen Swiss Guards and a resident of the hotel where Francis lives have recently tested positive.\\n\\n“We are very worried,” Zampini said, noting that the Vatican has strong regulations about keeping social distancing and washing hands within the territory. “We have all protocols in place, but still we have cases.”\\n\\nHe acknowledged, though, that the contagion within the Vatican has merely driven home the danger of the virus so that the Vatican itself can be witness to what the rest of the world is experiencing and help be part of the solution.\\n\\nThe commission is working to address the current needs of the church around the world with concrete acts of assistance, while also developing policy recommendations for how governments and institutions can re-think global economic, environmental, social, health care and other structures to be more equitable and sustainable.\\n\\n___\\n\\nAritz Parra in Madrid contributed.\\n\\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\\n\\nCopyright © 2020 The Washington Times, LLC.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Allison P. Wheeler is an assistant professor of pathology, microbiology and immunology at Vanderbilt and one of the principal investigators of a convalescent plasma trial at Vanderbilt that was launched with Ms. Parton’s funding. Through a $34 million National Institutes of Health grant, that research was later expanded to 51 additional sites around the country. The team’s goal is to treat 500 patients with convalescent plasma and 500 others with a placebo.\\n\\n“I am overwhelmed by the donor response to our study,” Dr. Wheeler said. “This has been a hard year for everybody, and seeing how much people really want to help has been a high point for me. But blood is a limited resource. At this time, we absolutely couldn’t give convalescent plasma to everyone who may benefit. We just wouldn’t have enough plasma.”\\n\\nEnter The Rock.\\n\\nThe wrestler-turned-movie-star otherwise known as Dwayne Johnson has stepped up to be a spokesman for a public-private initiative called “The Fight Is in Us.” Mr. Johnson encourages Covid-19 survivors to donate plasma: “If you survived it, then you’re the heroes we need,” he says in a P.S.A. “You fought for your life. Now, let’s work together to take down Covid-19.”\\n\\nThe Food and Drug Administration has not yet approved convalescent plasma as a treatment for Covid-19, but it does allow emergency use in life-threatening cases. Creating a stockpile of convalescent plasma would make it possible to treat many more severely ill patients during resurgences of the virus before a vaccine is widely available. (Donating is possible all over the country. Click here to find out how.)\\n\\nA caveat: Though the early evidence suggests that Covid reinfections are exceedingly rare, at least within this first year of the pandemic, it is far too soon to believe that surviving the virus means you are safe. You still need to avoid large gatherings. You still need to keep your distance from people outside your immediate household. You still need to wear a mask.\\n\\nBut being a survivor means you can help. Donating plasma takes a couple of hours, and it’s no more painful than a needle stick. Your own body will replenish the plasma within a day or two, antibodies included.\\n\\nAt my last donation, I watched a friend’s small, socially-distanced wedding on Zoom while I was connected to the apheresis machine, which was collecting my blood and sorting it into parts — plasma, platelets, white blood cells and red blood cells. Nothing says Peak 2020 like donating antibodies while watching someone get married on your phone. It was joyful event, even on a tiny screen. I held my phone with one hand, and I squeezed a ball with the other, helping the blood move through the machine more quickly. I watched my friends promise to love each other through good times and bad, in sickness and in health, and I prayed for their health. For everybody’s health.\\n\\nJoy and hope may not be what you expect to find in a university laboratory, but it’s what I felt anyway.

       "  'text': 'Kent Sepkowitz is a CNN medical analyst and a physician and infection control expert at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.\\n\\n(CNN) Costco, a popular wholesale store with locations across the US, has announced that it will sell a direct-to-consumer diagnostic test for Covid-19, joining a growing list of retailers providing diagnostic tests.\\n\\nBut there are problems with the program, starting with the cost. The test is not cheap, especially for those looking to test themselves and family more than once. At Costco, the kit costs $129 for the most basic version and $139 for the fancy version that includes video instructions. Federal law mandates that private insurers, Medicare and Medicaid cover Covid-19 tests without any cost to the patient. Whether they will pay fully for a more bells and whistles program such as that provided by Costco likely will vary plan to plan.\\n\\nThat price is actually cheaper than buying the at-home kit directly from AZOVA , the company that administers the program, which charges at least $20 more. AZOVA is also encouraging pharmacies to offer the kits. In a blog entry titled, \"Four ways to generate revenue when you offer Covid-19 testing in your pharmacy and on your website,\" lists some tips on how pharmacies can maximize profits, including receiving a $22 to $29 administration fee for in-pharmacy tests and $5 for each test ordered online and conducted at home, noting that \"you don\\'t need to do anything but add a link to your website\" to get the five bucks a pop.\\n\\nAs for the speed of the result -- sorry, you\\'ll have to wait at least a couple days. The term \"home test\" evokes the home pregnancy test approach where the wait for the big reveal is measured in minutes. However, for the Covid-19 test, the \"home\" refers only to where you collect the specimen, not where you run the test. This is performed by a lab reached by (hopefully) overnight mail.\\n\\nAZOVA promises a result by email one to three days after receipt of the kit in an approved lab. But there is an additional lag in the time of one to three days for the kit to be delivered to you at home if you order it online. In other words, order on Monday and get your test result at the earliest on Wednesday but as late as the weekend. (Costco advertises a slightly quicker turnaround between ordering the kit and receiving it at your home.) So those who would want to use the test for assurance prior to seeing the family or returning to the office need to plan many days in advance.\\n\\nWhich brings us to accuracy. The involved companies claim the test is excellent, with the website advertising 98% sensitivity and 99% specificity, meaning almost every case is detected by the test with very few false positives. But we don\\'t know how accurate a test really is until people have used it in real life conditions, rather than under perfected lab conditions. OraSure experienced this difference when its home test for HIV , once approved, showed a higher false positive rate than clinical trials had shown.\\n\\nAnd that was the good old days, before the Trump administration weakened the process for how lab tests can gain emergency use authorization (EUA) through the FDA . In the name of swiftness, the FDA decided to allow qualified labs themselves to determine whether their test worked. No longer is the company\\'s data subjected to FDA scrutiny prior to issuing EUA. It is possible therefore that some tests that would not have received FDA emergency authorization six months ago are now receiving a greenlight.\\n\\nPlus, there is the simple fact that a test performed today may accurately show no infection, but by the time the result is available -- days later -- the same person may have become infected. The immediacy of the test result, therefore, is crucial for both personal and public health decisions.\\n\\nSo here we are, eight months into the pandemic and still waiting for an accurate, fast, cheap, readily available test -- the game-changer first promised in April. The at-home version in its current form may be helpful for worried families but will not be a game-changer from a public health perspective.\\n\\nChina, But having several companies trying to solve a problem the Trump administration should have resolved long ago, similar to governments in South Korea Germany and other countries, is a faintly hopeful sign.\\n\\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion\\'s new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\\n\\nThe collaborating companies seem to understand that the basic principle for controlling the Covid-19 pandemic is the same as for every infectious disease: it is necessary to have a rapid and reliable test to identify who is potentially infectious. Otherwise we are simply trying to swat flies in a pitch-dark room, hitting and missing, missing and hitting, with no hope of knowing anything at all about the effectiveness of our efforts. This single profound limitation more than anything else has led us into America\\'s historic public health catastrophe.',\n",

The country’s contact-tracing program, paired with mandatory quarantines, had been held up as a model of how to contain outbreaks. Now German health authorities are unable to identify where 75 percent of new infections come from.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“We no longer have control of the spread of the virus,” Merkel said at a Berlin news conference, noting that the number of patients in the country’s intensive care units had doubled in the past 10 days.\\n\\n“If the tempo of infections stays the same, we will reach the capacity of our health-care system within weeks,” she said. “That’s why it’s completely clear that we need to act and act now.”\\n\\nStarting Friday in France and Monday in Germany, restaurants, cafes and bars will close. In France, Macron said, residents will be permitted to leave their homes only for essential work or medical reasons and will be required to present “attestation forms” when they do. Leaders of Germany’s 16 federal states also agreed to new restrictions on social contacts, limiting public gatherings to a maximum of two households, with a limit of 10 people.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBoth Germany and France plan to keep schools open — a priority for many European countries in this second wave — and, unlike in the spring, nursing home visits will be allowed.\\n\\nCountries across the continent have desperately sought to avoid the return of national lockdowns. Switzerland on Wednesday ordered clubs closed and added new mask requirements, hoping to head off the need for more comprehensive, economy-crippling measures.\\n\\nBut governments are finding that more targeted, piecemeal measures may not be sufficient. Appeals by both French and German leaders to reduce contacts in recent weeks failed to slow the growth of new cases.\\n\\nFrance’s new lockdown was a necessary last resort in the face of troubling figures, Macron said. “I have decided that we must return to confinement,” he said. “The whole territory is concerned.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nFrance on Sunday reported a record 52,010 new confirmed coronavirus infections from the previous 24 hours. It has also seen a steep rise in hospitalizations. On Monday, for instance, French hospitals tracked more than 1,300 new covid-19 patients, the highest one-day total since early April, in the peak of the first wave.\\n\\nMacron talked his nation through all the options — including “herd immunity,” which he said would result in at least 400,000 deaths, in a country with a population of roughly 67 million people, and which was therefore not acceptable.\\n\\n“I do not believe in the opposition between health and the economy,” Macron said, defending his decision to impose a second lockdown. “For us, nothing is more important than human life.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhile Germany has greater ICU capacity than most countries in Europe and fewer daily cases than France, Spain and Britain, infections have been growing exponentially. Germany recorded 14,964 new cases Wednesday, doubling from just a week earlier.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nParties and gatherings in public and private spaces were “unacceptable,” Merkel said. Social sacrifices must be made to ensure that schools can remain open, she said.\\n\\nGerman industry groups said a new lockdown would be a “death blow.” As Merkel and state leaders hashed out new measures over a video call, thousands of restaurant and bar owners marched to the Chancellery. A van pulled a coffin on a trailer with the words “Entertainment Sector” on the side.\\n\\nGermany said it will make an additional $12 billion available to compensate businesses affected by the closures.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe closures were a “very hard decision,” Health Minister Jens Spahn, who himself contracted the novel coronavirus last week, told German radio. But it was necessary, he said.\\n\\n“If we wait until the intensive care units are full, it will be too late,” he said.\\n\\n“We had predicted there would be this second wave, but we ourselves are surprised by the brutality of what’s been happening over the past 10 days,” Jean-François Delfraissy, an immunologist and the chair of the French government’s scientific advisory covid-19 response board, told France’s RTL radio on Monday.',\n",

       "  'text': \"LANSING, Mich. — President Donald Trump's campaign stops on Tuesday read like a rundown of some of the nation's top coronavirus hot spots.\\n\\nThere was Wisconsin, where the rate of positive tests has passed 25 percent. Nebraska, where health officials are reporting the highest number of hospitalizations since the start of the pandemic. And Michigan, where the number of cases has nearly doubled in recent weeks, and some medical facilities are nearing capacity amid the surge in new infections.\\n\\nBut at the campaign events themselves, and at similar rallies over the presidential race's waning days, the surging numbers haven't been the coronavirus issue on which he has appeared most focused.\\n\\n“Covid, covid, covid, covid, covid, covid cases — do you ever notice they use the word 'cases'? Like Barron Trump has a case, sniffles, one Kleenex and he was better,” Trump told a tightly packed, mostly mask-less crowd here in Michigan's state capital, in remarks downplaying the severity of the virus.\\n\\nCoronavirus cases are only up because of increased testing, he said, and media coverage of the pandemic is being used to make him look bad. Regarding testing, he said, “in many ways I hate it. We test everybody. … If I told them to cut testing in half and we cut our testing in half, they would go crazy because the cases would go down at approximately half, right?”\\n\\nIn the final days of his campaign, Trump is contending with a fall wave of coronavirus infections that he had once predicted wouldn’t be coming, and that people close to the campaign dismissed as an impossibility over the summer as they planned to tout an economic recovery in the homestretch of the race.\\n\\nNow, the battleground states of Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin are being hit particularly hard with overwhelmed hospitals and rising death tolls in Wisconsin and Minnesota. Trump cannot afford to lose all four of those states, even if he is able to hold on to the rest of the states he won in 2016, and polls indicate he has consistently been trailing Democratic rival Joe Biden there for months.\\n\\nBut Trump's response to the fall surge has been to carry on with even more of his rallies in those areas, with no additional safety measures put in place, and to dismiss the risk. At a rally in Wisconsin over the weekend — where the state has had to set up a field hospital to contend with the onslaught of cases — Trump baselessly argued that the death toll may not be as high as it seems.\\n\\n“If somebody is terminally ill with cancer and they have Covid, we report them. And doctors get more money and hospitals get more money. Think of this incentive,” Trump told the Wisconsin rally. “If somebody has a really bad heart and they are close to death, even if they're not but they have a very bad heart and they get Covid, they put it down to Covid. Other countries are putting it down to heart. So we are going to start looking at things.”\\n\\nVice President Mike Pence has continued to travel to campaign events, despite coronavirus diagnoses over the past week for at least five members of his staff or inner circle. He held an event Monday in Minnesota — where new cases, hospitalizations and deaths are spiking — that violated the state’s public health rules about large gatherings.\\n\\nIt's a strategy that the campaign believes holds appeal for the president's base of white working-class voters, but it has alienated other key groups, like seniors and women. Over the summer, Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway urged Trump to resume his daily coronavirus briefings to project the image of a commander in chief taking charge of a crisis as his numbers among seniors started to tumble in states like Florida. Trump’s advisers say they saw those numbers starting to come back in September.\\n\\nStill, Trump has spent the race's last weeks making the case that the country is “rounding the turn” with the pandemic, blaming the fall spike in cases on an increase in testing rather than more widespread illness — even though cases have increased more than testing rates, and hospitalizations are up. Rather than urging people to practice social distancing and wear masks to try to tamp down the spikes, Trump continues to pack in supporters closely together at his rallies and doesn't require attendees to wear a mask.\\n\\nAnd with no vaccine coming before the election, Trump has shifted the focus more to treatments in development — a message that he believes helps him, even though those medications remain inaccessible for most Americans.\\n\\n“Trump’s play is to run right up the middle — continue to have massive rallies in states despite the fact that the virus is surging and hope he breaks through the defense and ends up in the end zone somehow,” said major Trump donor Dan Eberhardt. “It is brazen and bold. It is also the only play he has. He is behind and being heavily outspent.”\",\n",

Thom Tillis has had a busy week.\\n\\nTillis, a first-term Republican senator, voted to confirm a new Supreme Court justice, campaigned with Vice President Mike Pence, gave several rounds of media interviews and announced a packed schedule of events in the final days of his re-election bid.\\n\\nTillis\\' Democratic challenger, Cal Cunningham, rocked by weeks of controversy, has been a bit harder to find.\\n\\nHis last scheduled interview was several weeks ago, and journalists requesting sit-downs say their calls go unreturned. While he\\'s still speaking to voters, many events are entirely virtual, and local reporters complain that his campaign is no longer sending out schedules to the media.\\n\\nAnd yet his campaign, pivotal in determining who controls the Senate, is still considered one of the Democrats\\' best chances to flip a Senate seat this year.\\n\\nTillis announced that he had tested positive for the coronavirus on Oct. 2, after having attended a White House event in honor of Amy Coney Barrett. The same day, Cunningham, a married father of two and an officer in the Army Reserve who has centered his campaign on his character, was caught in a sexting scandal amid allegations of an extramarital relationship.\\n\\nSince then, the two candidates in what\\'s on track to be the most expensive Senate race in U.S. history have taken vastly different approaches to their campaigns. Cunningham has largely avoided public events and the media, keeping his focus on the virus and health care.\\n\\nTillis, on the other hand, has made a point of being out in public. He has appeared with President Donald Trump and other high-profile Republicans, using whatever opportunity he can to highlight what he argues is a lack of transparency from Cunningham.\\n\\n\"More importantly than anything, he\\'s broken our trust,\" Tillis said Tuesday while campaigning with Pence in Greensboro. \"He\\'s run on a campaign of trust and honor. Now we know he\\'s not been truthful to his family and to his voters and he\\'s not been honorable to the very uniform that he wears.\"\\n\\nWhile each party hoped that its opponent\\'s missteps would lead to his undoing, the race has remained surprisingly stable, with Cunningham consistently polling a few points ahead of Tillis, usually within the margin of error.\\n\\nA Washington Post/ABC News poll conducted Oct. 12 to 17 found Cunningham leading, with 49 percent of likely voters, compared to Tillis\\' 47 percent. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.5 points.\\n\\nMany voters in North Carolina expressed negative attitudes about both candidates, but they said personal feelings wouldn\\'t influence their votes. Rather, the national electoral environment and the presidential race are driving their choices.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve already voted for Trump,\" said James Hatley, 76, of Concord, a Charlotte exurb where Democrats are hoping to cut into Trump\\'s nearly 20-point margin from 2016.\\n\\n\"I\\'m not much of a fan of Tillis. Perhaps they were all being too carefree about the virus. But I voted for him, too, because I\\'m not a liberal,\" Hatley said.\\n\\nHis wife, Doris Hatley, 73, who also voted early for Trump, said she was frustrated with Tillis for having publicly criticized the president earlier on in his term, such as when he wrote an op-ed article opposing Trump\\'s plan to fund his signature border wall.\\n\\nHatley said that she had initially been open to finding another Republican to fill Tillis\\' seat but that she was left with few options after his only primary challenger dropped out at the end of last year.\\n\\n\"Tillis is just OK. But I was on my iPad the other night, I\\'m addicted to that thing, and I was reading something about \\'11 reasons why Christians should vote Trump,\\'\" Doris Hatley said. \"And so that sums it up. I\\'m Christian, and I\\'m conservative, and I voted Republican on all of the ballots.\"\\n\\nSimilarly, many Democrats say that despite their own feelings about marital infidelity, Cunningham\\'s indiscretions wouldn\\'t affect their votes for him.\\n\\n\"Tillis has to go. Trump has to go,\" said Sam Henry, 51, laughing off the suggestion that the revelations about Cunningham might change her mind.\\n\\nPolitical watchers in North Carolina say the top of the ticket will probably determine which Senate candidate comes out ahead.\\n\\n\"I\\'m betting if Biden wins, Cunningham wins. If Trump wins, Tillis wins,\" said Pope McCorkle, a longtime North Carolina Democratic consultant who runs Duke University\\'s Polis Center for Politics, adding that Trump had \"lowered the bar\" for the impact of a political sex scandal.\\n\\nCarter Wrenn, a Republican political consultant in the state who advised Tillis\\' primary challenger. Garland Tucker, said he thought voters from both parties would be more than willing to overlook any issues they may have about the candidates given that the balance of the Senate could easily hinge on North Carolina.\\n\\n\"There\\'s a group of Republicans out there that aren\\'t enthusiastic about Tillis. But at the end of the day, if their other choice is a Democratic Senate, it\\'s not that difficult,\" he said. \"But I\\'m inclined to think that this race is a coin toss.\"\\n\\nJoe Biden polls about 2.4 points ahead of Trump in North Carolina, according to averages of the state, mostly mirroring the Senate race polls.\\n\\nEach party has privately expressed some optimism about dragging its Senate candidate over the finish line.\\n\\n\"I think Tillis is getting back in this one, because his opponent ended up having more affairs than you\\'re allowed to have at one time,\" Trump told donors at a private fundraiser last week in Nashville, Tennessee, ahead of the final presidential debate, The Washington Post reported.\\n\\nDuring a campaign stop in the Raleigh area with Biden last week, Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper was caught on a hot mic by a local TV station acknowledging that Cunningham\\'s infidelity had caused him some trouble. Still, he said he remained hopeful.\\n\\n\"We\\'re going to all get across the line,\" Cooper told Biden. \"I think Cal\\'s going to get across the line, too. I know that\\'s frustrating. We\\'ll get it across.\"\\n\\nIn the final days of the race, neither campaign is backing down from its efforts to capitalize on the other\\'s perceived weakness.\\n\\nTillis has run ads casting doubt on Cunningham\\'s trustworthiness, trying to cut against the image of an Army officer who weeded out corrupt military contractors in Iraq.\\n\\n\"The Code of Military Justice. All soldiers live by it. Just like the oath we all take,\" veterans narrating a video ad for Tillis say. \"Cal Cunningham violated his oath when he had an affair with another soldier\\'s wife.\"\\n\\nOn Friday, Tillis tweeted a video from a local TV station showing a reporter sitting next to an empty chair and stating: \"We continue to reach out to the Cunningham campaign and offer an open invitation for Cal Cunningham to sit down with us for a one-on-one interview, an invitation so far he continues to decline.\"\\n\\nCunningham released an ad over the weekend accusing Tillis of trying to distract from his own record.\\n\\n\"Thom Tillis is desperately attacking my personal life because he doesn\\'t want to talk about his own record. Thousands of families without health care, unaffordable prescriptions and a relentless effort to take away coverage from people with pre-existing conditions,\" Cunningham says in the ad. \"It may be my name on the ballot, but it\\'s your health care.\"\\n\\nAndrew Romeo, a spokesperson for the Tillis campaign, said Cunningham\\'s ad was evidence that the scandal was having an impact, regardless of what the polls showed.\\n\\n\"It won\\'t work. North Carolinians know a fraud when they see one and no amount of last-minute, panicked TV ads can change the fact that Cunningham\\'s lies, hypocrisy and breach of the Military Code Of Justice will lead to his demise on November 3rd,\" Romeo said in a statement.\\n\\nRachel Petri, a spokesperson for the Cunningham campaign, said Tillis was relying on \"desperate, personal attacks\" because he could not defend \"botching the Covid-19 response.\"\\n\\nDemocrats point to the virtual events that Cunningham has held to push back against the suggestion that he is hiding from the media.\\n\\nBut Cunningham hasn\\'t willingly answered media questions in weeks.\\n\\nWhen he stopped by a TV station at an unannounced in-person appearance at a barbershop last week, Cunningham didn\\'t engage on questions about his scandal.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve said what I\\'m going to say about personal matters,\" Cunningham responded. \"I think the voters of North Carolina want me talking with them about the things that are leading them to vote, which are about how we get the economy moving, how we deal with the health care challenges.\"',\n",

       "  'text': \"LANSING, Mich. — President Donald Trump's campaign stops on Tuesday read like a rundown of some of the nation's top coronavirus hot spots.\\n\\nThere was Wisconsin, where the rate of positive tests has passed 25 percent. Nebraska, where health officials are reporting the highest number of hospitalizations since the start of the pandemic. And Michigan, where the number of cases has nearly doubled in recent weeks, and some medical facilities are nearing capacity amid the surge in new infections.\\n\\nBut at the campaign events themselves, and at similar rallies over the presidential race's waning days, the surging numbers haven't been the coronavirus issue on which he has appeared most focused.\\n\\n“Covid, covid, covid, covid, covid, covid cases — do you ever notice they use the word 'cases'? Like Barron Trump has a case, sniffles, one Kleenex and he was better,” Trump told a tightly packed, mostly mask-less crowd here in Michigan's state capital, in remarks downplaying the severity of the virus.\\n\\nCoronavirus cases are only up because of increased testing, he said, and media coverage of the pandemic is being used to make him look bad. Regarding testing, he said, “in many ways I hate it. We test everybody. … If I told them to cut testing in half and we cut our testing in half, they would go crazy because the cases would go down at approximately half, right?”\\n\\nIn the final days of his campaign, Trump is contending with a fall wave of coronavirus infections that he had once predicted wouldn’t be coming, and that people close to the campaign dismissed as an impossibility over the summer as they planned to tout an economic recovery in the homestretch of the race.\\n\\nNow, the battleground states of Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin are being hit particularly hard with overwhelmed hospitals and rising death tolls in Wisconsin and Minnesota. Trump cannot afford to lose all four of those states, even if he is able to hold on to the rest of the states he won in 2016, and polls indicate he has consistently been trailing Democratic rival Joe Biden there for months.\\n\\nBut Trump's response to the fall surge has been to carry on with even more of his rallies in those areas, with no additional safety measures put in place, and to dismiss the risk. At a rally in Wisconsin over the weekend — where the state has had to set up a field hospital to contend with the onslaught of cases — Trump baselessly argued that the death toll may not be as high as it seems.\\n\\n“If somebody is terminally ill with cancer and they have Covid, we report them. And doctors get more money and hospitals get more money. Think of this incentive,” Trump told the Wisconsin rally. “If somebody has a really bad heart and they are close to death, even if they're not but they have a very bad heart and they get Covid, they put it down to Covid. Other countries are putting it down to heart. So we are going to start looking at things.”\\n\\nVice President Mike Pence has continued to travel to campaign events, despite coronavirus diagnoses over the past week for at least five members of his staff or inner circle. He held an event Monday in Minnesota — where new cases, hospitalizations and deaths are spiking — that violated the state’s public health rules about large gatherings.\\n\\nIt's a strategy that the campaign believes holds appeal for the president's base of white working-class voters, but it has alienated other key groups, like seniors and women. Over the summer, Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway urged Trump to resume his daily coronavirus briefings to project the image of a commander in chief taking charge of a crisis as his numbers among seniors started to tumble in states like Florida. Trump’s advisers say they saw those numbers starting to come back in September.\\n\\nStill, Trump has spent the race's last weeks making the case that the country is “rounding the turn” with the pandemic, blaming the fall spike in cases on an increase in testing rather than more widespread illness — even though cases have increased more than testing rates, and hospitalizations are up. Rather than urging people to practice social distancing and wear masks to try to tamp down the spikes, Trump continues to pack in supporters closely together at his rallies and doesn't require attendees to wear a mask.\\n\\nAnd with no vaccine coming before the election, Trump has shifted the focus more to treatments in development — a message that he believes helps him, even though those medications remain inaccessible for most Americans.\\n\\n“Trump’s play is to run right up the middle — continue to have massive rallies in states despite the fact that the virus is surging and hope he breaks through the defense and ends up in the end zone somehow,” said major Trump donor Dan Eberhardt. “It is brazen and bold. It is also the only play he has. He is behind and being heavily outspent.”\",\n",

Alessandra Tarantino / AP\\n\\nZampini said he hoped Francis would don a mask at least when he greeted people during the general audience. \"We are working on that,\" he said.\\n\\nGet Breaking News Delivered to Your Inbox\\n\\nFrancis has only been seen wearing a mask in public twice: On Sept. 9 as he entered and exited his general audience, and last week during a two-hour interfaith prayer service in downtown Rome.\\n\\nWhile Francis\\' lung condition could explain his reluctance to wear a mask, there has been no comment from the Vatican about why protocol officials allow other people to get close to him without donning face protection. People who have had private meetings with him recently said no masks were worn and no proof of recent negative virus tests required. Vatican regulations require masks indoors and out when social distancing cannot be guaranteed.\\n\\nAt the start of the audience, Francis again apologized that he wouldn\\'t descend into the crowd to greet well-wishers because he said doing so would create a crowd around him.\\n\\n\"And this goes against the precautions we need before this lady called COVID, who does us so much harm,\" Francis said from the stage of the Vatican auditorium. \"For this reason, please forgive me that I don\\'t go down to greet you. I greet you from here and I keep you in my heart, and please keep me in your heart and pray for me.\"\\n\\nItaly, the first country in the West to be slammed by the pandemic, has seen a sharp rebound in infections in recent weeks that prompted the government to close restaurants and bars at night and shutter theaters, gyms and pools. Public health officials are urging people to stay home as much as possible.\\n\\nFrancis\\' audience — which in pre-pandemic times would draw thousands of people each week to St. Peter\\'s Square or the auditorium — featured only a few hundred people Wednesday.\\n\\nIn August, Francis warned against any prospect that rich people would get priority for a coronavirus vaccine. \"The pandemic is a crisis. You don\\'t come out of it the same – either better or worse,\\'\\' Francis said.',\n",

       "  'text': '(CNN) Immunity to Covid-19 infection lingers for at least five months, researchers reported -- and probably longer than that.\\n\\nWhile the report may seem confusing and contradictory to a similar report out of Britain this week , it really isn\\'t. There is more than one wave of infection control in the human body.\\n\\nPeople\\'s bodies produce an army of immune compounds in response to an infection and some are overwhelming at first, dying off quickly, while others build up more slowly. Measurements that show a waning antibody response in the first months after infection might be measuring this first wave -- but there\\'s a second team building its forces in the background.\\n\\nThe new report out Wednesday shows 90% of people who recover from Covid-19 infections keep a stable overall antibody response.\\n\\n\"While some reports have come out saying antibodies to this virus go away quickly, we have found just the opposite -- that more than 90% of people who were mildly or moderately ill produce an antibody response strong enough to neutralize the virus, and the response is maintained for many months,\" Florian Krammer, a professor of vaccinology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, who led the study team, said in a statement.\\n\\n\"This is essential for effective vaccine development.\"\\n\\nThe team looked at the antibody responses of more than 30,000 people who tested positive for Covid-19 at Mount Sinai\\'s Health System between March and October. They characterized their antibody responses as low, moderate or high. More than 90% had moderate to high levels, or titers, of antibodies to the spike protein of the virus -- the structure it uses to grapple the cells it infects.\\n\\nThey then closely studied 121 patients who recovered and donated their plasma -- once three months after they first developed symptoms, and again five months later.\\n\\nThey did see a drop-off in some antibodies. But others persisted, they reported in the journal Science.\\n\\n\"The serum antibody titer we measured in individuals initially were likely produced by plasmablasts, cells that act as first responders to an invading virus and come together to produce initial bouts of antibodies whose strength soon wanes,\" said Dr. Ania Wajnberg, director of Clinical Antibody Testing at the Mount Sinai Hospital.\\n\\n\"The sustained antibody levels that we subsequently observed are likely produced by long-lived plasma cells in the bone marrow. This is similar to what we see in other viruses and likely means they are here to stay. We will continue to follow this group over time to see if these levels remain stable as we suspect and hope they will.\"\\n\\nAntibodies are not the only protection the immune system musters against infection, but they are an important first line of defense.\\n\\n\"Although this cannot provide conclusive evidence that these antibody responses protect from reinfection, we believe it is very likely that they will decrease the odds ratio of reinfection,\" the team wrote.\\n\\nCovid-19 has only been around for a little under a year, so scientists are still learning about it. Stories of people becoming infected more than once are mostly anecdotal, and few and far between.\\n\\nThere\\'s obvious concern about this. It would be far better for getting rid of the pandemic if people developed permanent immunity to the virus after an infection. And, of course, immunity would be vital for a vaccine to work well.\\n\\nIt happens with other viruses. Measles is an example. One bout of measles usually leaves someone immune for life -- an effect known as sterilizing immunity. The same was true for smallpox, before that virus was eradicated in the 1970s by a global vaccination campaign. And proper vaccination against measles and smallpox completely protects against infection.\\n\\nBut respiratory viruses such as influenza are trickier. People can catch flu over and over again and flu vaccines generally provide only partial protection against infection and severe disease. Part of that\\'s due to flu\\'s tendency to mutate.\\n\\nCoronaviruses seem to fall in between. They can cause the common cold, but because they are not usually deadly, they are not as well studied. Until Covid-19\\'s deadly cousin SARS came along, there was little interest in coronaviruses.\\n\\nStill, there is evidence that people can and do develop some immunity to coronaviruses.\\n\\n\"We know from work with common human coronaviruses that neutralizing antibodies are induced, and these antibodies can last for years and provide protection from reinfection or attenuate disease, even if individuals get reinfected,\" Wajnberg and colleagues wrote.\\n\\n\"It is still unclear if infection with SARS-CoV-2 in humans protects from reinfection and for how long.\"\\n\\nGet CNN Health\\'s weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\\n\\nThe next important step, they said, will be to establish what are known as correlates of protection. These are compounds that can be measured in the blood that will tell doctors whether someone is immune -- so that it won\\'t be necessary to wait and see if they get infected again after one bout, or after getting a vaccine.',\n",

       "  'text': 'David Holtgrave, PhD, is the dean of the University at Albany School of Public Health and SUNY Distinguished Professor. His three-decade career in public health has included senior positions at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Emory University and Johns Hopkins University, and he served on the Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS during President Obama\\'s administration. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.\\n\\n(CNN) The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy has just listed \" ending the Covid-19 pandemic \" as an administration achievement; however, the epidemic continues to worsen .\\n\\nAnd a number of administration errors have led to the current dire circumstances.\\n\\nWe all know what a mistake in medicine looks like. A surgeon performs a procedure and leaves an instrument inside a patient ; that is an obvious medical error. But in public health, what constitutes a mistake is a bit more elusive since there are often multiple stakeholders and decision makers charting a course for an entire population.\\n\\nSometimes you can pinpoint a public health error (the crisis of lead in the drinking water in Flint , Michigan, being a clear example). But mostly the responsibility becomes more diffuse and harder to gauge.\\n\\nIn an academic paper, I\\'ve offered a possible definition : \"a public health error occurs when one or more stakeholders in a public health system commit a cognizant, negligent act of commission or omission that fails to achieve necessary public health outcomes.\" Simply being too complacent in the face of a grave public health challenge could be considered an error. Given this definition, the current administration has committed multiple public health errors that have harmed the national Covid-19 response.\\n\\nThird, the administration provided some personal protective equipment but failed to make supplies of it for health care workers and schools available at the scale necessary to meet the needs. Without sufficient supplies of the basic equipment needed, it is hard to protect yourself from SARS-CoV-2.\\n\\nFifth, even after states like New York showed that physical distancing (in many forms), mask use, avoidance of large gatherings, hand sanitization, staying home when ill, and other basic techniques served to bring down cases, hospitalizations and death rates, the administration encouraged states to abandon such effective strategies even in the face of widespread community transmission (such as in Florida ) and if they did not, the President encouraged residents of jurisdictions such as Michigan to \" liberate \" their state.\\n\\nSixth, the President chose to demonize researchers whose findings did not suit him (such as calling the work of researchers finding no benefit to hydroxychloroquine, an \" enemy statement \"), thereby putting some scientists in the position of not only defending their science but also their motives for conducting urgent and important research in the first place. Such assaults on science and scientists can lead researchers to think twice about engaging in potentially lifesaving work, and can set back the scientific process such that evidence-based answers to pressing societal challenges are slower in their evolution.\\n\\nTenth, the devastating disparities of Covid-19 in communities of color are matters of social justice , and yet the President barely seems to notice or acknowledge them. Clearly, to alleviate the suffering from Covid-19 in the US, one must address the injustice of these racial, ethnic and socioeconomic disparities and begin to better build health equity.\\n\\nEleventh, if the administration wanted to address these issues, there would be a comprehensive, evidence-based national Covid-19 strategy , but there is no such national plan at this point. Without a plan in place, there can be no tracking of key metrics, no informed mid-course corrections, and little accountability.\\n\\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion\\'s new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\\n\\nGoing forward, I encourage the administration and all public health decision makers to keep in mind this definition of a public health error, to avoid such serious mistakes, and to accept the responsibility for their errors when they do occur. Just like surgeons go to great lengths to avoid leaving instruments inside of patients, we must avoid errors in public health. With either type of error, the outcomes can be deadly and in public health the devastation can be even more widespread.',\n",

Seven deaths have been recorded.\\n\\nEaster was an important milestone in the United States because President Donald Trump had said a month earlier he wanted the country \"opened up and just raring to go\" by the holiday\\n\\nAt that point, 1.7 million people had been infected and 110,000 had been killed by the virus -- globally. On Friday, those figures had passed 45 million cases and more than 1.1 million deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University.\\n\\nTaiwan has never had to enact strict lockdowns. Nor did it resort to drastic restrictions on civil freedoms, like in mainland China.\\n\\nInstead, Taiwan\\'s response focused on speed . Taiwanese authorities began screening passengers on direct flights from Wuhan, where the virus was first identified, on December 31, 2019 -- back when the virus was mostly the subject of rumors and limited reporting.\\n\\nTaiwan confirmed its first reported case of the novel coronavirus on January 21 and then banned Wuhan residents from traveling to the island. All passengers arriving from mainland China, Hong Kong and Macao were required to undergo screening.\\n\\nAll this happened before Wuhan itself went into lockdown on January 23. By March, Taiwan banned all foreign nationals from entering the island, apart from diplomats, residents and those with special entry visas.\\n\\nBut Taiwan has advantages its counterparts in the West do not.\\n\\nOne is geography -- Taiwan is an island, so it\\'s easier for officials to control entry and exit through its borders.\\n\\nJUST WATCHED Learning from Taiwan\\'s Covid-19 response Replay More Videos ...

Chen also said that the type of mass-testing schemes undertaken in mainland China, where millions of people are screened when a handful of cases are detected, are also unnecessary.\\n\\n\"Very careful contact tracing, and very stringent quarantines of close contacts are the best way to contain Covid-19,\" he said.',\n",

The Pfizer vaccine, as well as three others, are still in Phase 3 clinical trials in the United States, and no one knows if they work at all -- let alone to near perfection.\\n\\nVaccines by Pfizer and another pharmaceutical company, Moderna, utilize a new kind of technology in their Covid-19 vaccines -- no vaccine on the market has ever used it.\\n\\nOffit said that alone is reason for caution.\\n\\n\"This virus has been around for less than a year, and it causes a variety of clinical findings that we never would have predicted, and now we\\'re going to counter it with a vaccine that has no commercial experience? How about a little humility here?\" said Offit, a member of the FDA\\'s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee.\\n\\nAccording to a BioNTech statement sent to CNN, Sahin\\'s comment was \"based on preliminary antibody and T cell responses and a favorable safety profile observed in the study so far. He also noted that there is a need to wait for the efficacy data which is not available yet.\"\\n\\nPfizer\\'s CEO has made predictions about when it will be clear if a vaccine works or not.\\n\\nOn September 8, Albert Bourla told the Today show that \"we will have an answer by the end of October\" whether the vaccine works, adding that \"our model, our base case, predicts that we will have an answer in, by the end of October. Of course, this is only a prediction.\"\\n\\nOn October 16, Bourla made a similar comment in an open letter on his company\\'s website, stating that \"we may know whether or not our vaccine is effective by the end of October.\"\\n\\nBut on the investor call Tuesday -- just five days before the end of the month -- Bourla said the company hasn\\'t seen its vaccine data yet. Pfizer\\'s first opportunity to see that data will be when 32 people in its trial become sick with Covid-19 -- and Bourla told investors that this has not yet happened.\\n\\nReaching those 32 coronavirus cases will still not give the company the data it needs. An independent panel of experts will need to analyze those cases -- and that can take at least a week, Bourla told investors. That means the data couldn\\'t come in October, as Bourla had predicted.\\n\\nCNN reached out to Pfizer for a response.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t believe our CEO or we have said that the world should definitely expect an announcement at the end of the month. Rather, it\\'s that there was potential that we would know about efficacy by the end of the month. Nothing has changed,\" according to a company spokesperson.\\n\\nPredictions from the University of Oxford for September results\\n\\nPfizer isn\\'t the only company that\\'s made predictions that likely will not or did not come true.\\n\\nIn April, Sarah Gilbert, an Oxford researcher told The Times in the UK that she was \"80% confident\" the vaccine being developed by her team would work -- even though at that point Oxford had not even started their Phase 3 clinical trials\\n\\nIn May, CNN asked Oxford researcher Dr. Adrian Hill when the university\\'s trial would end.\\n\\n\"My guess is July would be good. August more likely. Might be September,\" he said. \"We\\'re aiming for September but hoping to finish before that.\"\\n\\nSeptember came and went. Even now, Oxford\\'s Phase 3 trial is still underway.\\n\\n\"We have seen with this pandemic that the spread and transmission rates have fluctuated making them challenging to predict, and important measures to control cases, such as the lockdown by the UK Government, have slowed the transmission rate,\" an Oxford spokesperson wrote in an email to CNN. \"We have consistently maintained that if transmission remained high, we may get enough data in a couple of months to see if the vaccine works, but if transmission levels drop, this process could take longer.\"\\n\\nViruses -- and vaccines -- are unpredictable\\n\\nThe spread of a virus is unpredictable -- and vaccine experts say that\\'s exactly why pharmaceutical companies should avoid making predictions.\\n\\nIn the Phase 3 trials, pharmaceutical companies vaccinate study participants and then see if they become infected in the course of their daily lives. When rates of the virus go down, fewer participants will become infected, which slows down the trial.\\n\\nEven after the clinical trials are completed, there can be problems with manufacturing. That\\'s been true for many vaccines and could be true of the Covid-19 vaccines as well.\\n\\n\"People don\\'t think about manufacturing, but manufacturing has killed a lot of products,\" said Norman Baylor, former director of the FDA\\'s Office of Vaccines Research and Review.\\n\\nGet CNN Health\\'s weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\\n\\nDrugs typically use chemicals, but vaccines deal with growing living material, which doesn\\'t always go as planned.\\n\\n\"It\\'s wilder and crazier when you\\'re involving living systems,\" Baylor said. \"Manufacturing a vaccine is a lot like cooking. A recipe may work fine one day but not the next.\"\\n\\nThat\\'s why vaccine experts say the best laid plans can go askew.\\n\\n\"The best-case scenario never happens,\" said Michael, the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research. \"Bumps and warts happen in vaccine development.\\n\\nOr to quote Berra once again, \"it ain\\'t over till it\\'s over.\"',\n",

Williamson/The Washington Post via Getty Images Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post via Getty Images\\n\\nAs coronavirus cases rise swiftly around the country, surpassing both the spring and summer surges, health officials brace for a coming wave of hospitalizations and deaths. Knowing which hospitals in which communities are reaching capacity could be key to an effective response to the growing crisis. That information is gathered by the federal government — but not shared openly with the public.\\n\\nNPR has obtained documents that give a snapshot of data the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services collects and analyzes daily. The documents — reports sent to agency staffers — highlight trends in hospitalizations and pinpoint cities nearing full hospital capacity and facilities under stress. They paint a granular picture of the strain on hospitals across the country that could help local citizens decide when to take extra precautions against COVID-19.\\n\\nWithholding this information from the public and the research community is a missed opportunity to help prevent outbreaks and even save lives, say public health and data experts who reviewed the documents for NPR.\\n\\n\"At this point, I think it\\'s reckless. It\\'s endangering people,\" says Ryan Panchadsaram, co-founder of the website COVID Exit Strategy and a former data official in the Obama administration. \"We\\'re now in the third wave, and I think our only way out is really open, transparent and actionable information.\"\\n\\nThe documents show that detailed information hospitals report to HHS every day is reviewed and analyzed — but circulation seems to be limited to a few dozen government staffers from HHS and its agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and National Institutes of Health, according to distribution lists reviewed by NPR. Only one member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, Adm. Brett Giroir, appears to receive the documents directly.\\n\\n\"Our goal is to be as transparent as possible, while still protecting privacy,\" an HHS spokesperson wrote in an email to NPR. \"HHS and the White House Coronavirus Task Force utilize hospital capacity data to gain greater insights into how COVID-19 is spreading and impacting the population, and to better inform response efforts like staff deployments and supply shipments.\"\\n\\nWhat data is being collected and shared internally?\\n\\nThe daily reports show county, city and hospital-level details, as well as national analyses that HHS does not post online.\\n\\ntoggle caption HHS\\n\\nFor instance, the most recent report obtained by NPR, dated Oct 27, lists cities where hospitals are filling up, including the metro areas of Atlanta, Minneapolis and Baltimore, where in-patient hospital beds are over 80% full. It also lists specific hospitals reaching max capacity, including facilities in Tampa, Birmingham and New York that are at over 95% ICU capacity and at risk of running out of intensive care beds.\\n\\nIn reviewing the analysis obtained by NPR, Panchadsaram says the local and hospital-level data HHS is collecting would be very useful to researchers and health leaders. \"That stuff isn\\'t easy to find at a national level,\" he says. \"There\\'s no one place [publicly] you can go to get all that data.\"\\n\\nHospitalization data is invaluable in looking ahead to see where and when outbreaks are getting worse, says Dr. Christopher Murray, director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. \"Right now, as we head into the fall and winter surge,\" Murray says, \"we\\'re trying to put more emphasis on predicting where systems will be overwhelmed.\"\\n\\nBut what\\'s missing for this kind of planning, he says, is \"exactly the information\" that appears in the internal report.\\n\\nNPR has reviewed several of these reports generated in the past month. They present trends in hospital use, including increases in ventilator usage, along with a growing number of inpatient and ICU beds being occupied by COVID-19 patients. The Oct. 27 report showed that all three measures have increased by 14%-16% in the past month.\\n\\nAbout 24% of U.S. hospitals are using more than 80% of their ICU capacity, based on reporting from nearly 5,000 \"priority facilities,\" and more hospitals have joined their ranks in recent weeks.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption HHS HHS\\n\\nResearchers say observing these trend lines can help the nation know how to prepare for surge and be ready to intervene before systems become overwhelmed.\\n\\nDaily hospitalization numbers in particular are key measures for tracking pandemic hotspots, Murray says, because they reflect the number of severe COVID-19 cases in a community.\\n\\n\"The best possible measure of where we are in the pandemic, and the one we would want to anchor modeling to, is daily hospitalizations,\" he says, which give an early warning of deaths that will likely follow.\\n\\nPanchadsaram\\'s data-tracking site COVID Exit Strategy pulls state-level hospital capacity estimates from HHS when they\\'re updated, which generally happens once a week. In reviewing the reports obtained by NPR, Panchadsaram says it\\'s clear that vital data is flowing into HHS daily. \"But sharing with the public seems to be an afterthought,\" he says.\\n\\nGaps in transparency for state and local leaders\\n\\nHHS tells NPR that more than 800 state-level employees have access to the daily hospitalization data it gathers, but only for their own state, unless another state grants them permission to view its data.\\n\\nWithout a larger view into national or regional data, some states — like Tennessee, which has eight bordering states — are missing out on valuable regional data, says Melissa McPheeters, who directs the Center for Improving the Public\\'s Health through Informatics at Vanderbilt University.\\n\\n\"Hospitals in Tennessee serve patients who are from Arkansas and Mississippi and Kentucky and Georgia and vice versa, and so we\\'re a little bit blind to what\\'s going on there,\" she says. \"When we see hospitals that are particularly near those state borders having increases, one of the things we can\\'t tell is: Is that because hospitals in an adjacent state are full? What\\'s going on there? And that could be a really important piece of the picture.\"\\n\\nLisa M. Lee, former chief science officer for public health surveillance at the CDC, now at Virginia Tech, says the federal government could help states work together across borders.\\n\\n\"It\\'s very challenging for states to get the multistate view of things,\" she says. \"It\\'s just a lot easier when there\\'s a knowledgeable third-party who can pull the data together, make them consistent across states and actually tell the story of what the information shows.\" Typically, she says, this role would be fulfilled by the CDC, but the agency was stripped of its role in collecting COVID-19 hospital data in July.\\n\\nThis kind of visibility into data could help policymakers decide how best to curb the spread of the virus. McPheeters and colleagues at Vanderbilt put out a report this week that found that Tennessee counties without mask mandates had more rapid increases in hospitalizations. That kind of analysis and insight would be possible at a much larger scale if HHS shared more granular hospitalization data, she says.\\n\\nIt could influence behavior among the public, says Lee. \"The neighborhood data, the county data and metro-area data can be really helpful for people to say, \\'Whoa, they\\'re not kidding, this is right here,\\'\" she says. \"It can help public health prevention folks get their messages across and get people to change their behavior.\"\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption HHS HHS\\n\\nA controversial data switch\\n\\nExperts who reviewed the internal documents for NPR say that even for the limited group of federal employees who get them, the daily reports are not as useful as they could be.\\n\\n\"We\\'re so focused on counting things but not contextualizing them,\" explains McPheeters. A community hospital might become overwhelmed at a different point than a big academic hospital, and without that context, she says, it\\'s impossible to tell: \"Is 75% [full] a good thing or is 75% a bad thing?\"\\n\\nHealth data experts NPR consulted had ideas on how to improve the analysis. For instance, Panchadsaram suggested that some of the county-level charts, currently presented as raw numbers, would be more useful if analyzed per capita. \"You really need to adjust it to the number of people [in an area] to get a sense of where things are being overwhelmed,\" he says.\\n\\nAnd the quality of the underlying data is a concern. Health experts say the data quality was compromised by a controversial shift in data collection from the CDC to HHS in July, and that the issues with data quality have not been fully resolved.\\n\\nHospitals have had to adjust to onerous new reporting requirements, and the hospital data is no longer checked and analyzed by seasoned epidemiologists and other experts at CDC.\\n\\nThe daily trend documents circulated at HHS include this disclaimer: \"This analysis depends on the data reported by hospitals. To the extent that the data is missing or inaccurate, this analysis will also reflect those issues.\"\\n\\nAccording to HHS data posted on Monday, just 62% of the nation\\'s hospitals reported all the required information last week.\\n\\nBut greater transparency, even of incomplete data, can be invaluable in a crisis, experts say.\\n\\nHHS told NPR that since it took over collecting hospital capacity data, it has \"consistently displayed state-level hospitalization data to help inform the public about COVID-19 prevalence in their communities.\"\\n\\nBut public health experts say the state level data isn\\'t detailed enough — and since the government is putting the effort into generating more granular daily analyses, it should share them.\\n\\n\"Even though they\\'re collecting all these things and putting so much effort behind it, it gets blocked when it tries to get out of the door,\" Panchadsaram says.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Francis is far from the only world figure to buck the safety protocols of the pandemic era. But his habits are particularly puzzling, given that he is 83, is missing part of a lung and has talked with clarity about the ravages of the virus. Vatican watchers are worried and say Francis seems to almost be daring an infection, perhaps while trying to show that his personable style won’t be cowed by the coronavirus’s danger.\\n\\nWhatever his motivations — Francis hasn’t said — the maskless pope has become an emblem for the risks facing the Roman Catholic Church, at a time when the virus is spreading rapidly across Europe.\\n\\nThe Vatican as a practice follows Italian health decisions, and in the spring, that meant adhering to a rigid lockdown that safeguarded the city-state from major infections. But in this second wave, Italy is trying to avoid a full shutdown and shield its economy. As a result, the Vatican is still keeping things running, as well — even though the tiny nation, home to 600-some people including a cadre of elderly cardinals, has little industry of its own to protect.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nUnlike in March, St. Peter’s Square is open. So is the basilica and museum. Meanwhile Francis, whose papacy was essentially livestream-only in March, has continued to huddle up close with bishops and clerics, while breaking the Vatican’s rules requiring mask-wearing indoors and out.\\n\\n“You’re supposed to follow your own rules. You’re the boss. It’s very disappointing he’s not doing it,” said the Rev. Thomas Reese, a Jesuit priest and a senior analyst at Religion News Service, who recently wrote a public letter to the pontiff making the case for why he should wear a mask.\\n\\n“I wrote that because I love him, not because I’m one of his opponents,” Reese said. “It’s tough coming and saying: ‘Pope, you’re wrong. Put on the mask.’ He’s finding it very frustrating, being a pastor under these circumstances, but get real — this is the world we live in now.”\\n\\nFrancis, over the past month, has had some close calls. Thirteen Swiss Guards, members of a group whose duties include protecting the pope, tested positive amid an outbreak that the Vatican now says it has contained. Another positive case was detected in the Santa Marta residence, where Francis lives. The pope also met Oct. 5 with an archbishop diplomat who later tested positive. (The Vatican was reportedly informed of the infection 18 days later, after the pope was out of the danger zone.)\\n\\nBut the most visible of Francis’s risks have come in his Wednesday audiences with the public. To gain entrance, the several hundred visitors have their temperatures checked at the city-state border and are required to wear masks. The pontiff, onstage in a large Vatican hall, keeps well away from the crowd, often offering an apology that he can’t come closer.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“We have to keep our distances,” Francis said at one of the events.\\n\\nThe pope ignores his own advice with the clerics who join him onstage. After the event, Francis shakes hands with prelates, who line up to receive a few words from him. When approaching the pope, they tend to remove or pull down their masks. On one occasion, Francis kissed the hand of a newly ordained priest.\\n\\nThis week, the Vatican announced that it was suspending the public audiences until further notice, after a crowd member from the Oct. 21 event tested positive. The Vatican said the change was meant to “avoid any possible future risk to the health of the participants.”\\n\\nDuring at least one public event — an Oct. 20 ceremony in Rome with other religious leaders, including Bartholomew I, the ecumenical patriarch of the Orthodox Church — Francis did wear his mask. Some speculated he did so because he was on Italian soil and obeying that nation’s laws.\\n\\nVatican watchers have a range of theories about Francis’s general aversion. Some think the masks might make it difficult for him to breathe. Others note that he has shrugged off other kinds of risk, and made a name for himself, well before coming pope, with on-the-ground work in the slums of Buenos Aires.\\n\\nThe Vatican press office has not addressed the pope’s reluctance to wear masks or adhere to social distancing norms, and did not respond to a request for comment. The topic is awkward for the clerics who work inside the Vatican, for whom Francis is both a monarch and a revered figure. Earlier this week, the Rev. Augusto Zampini, a member of a Vatican task force addressing the long-term social issues of the pandemic, suggested that some people in the Vatican were leaning on Francis to more often wear a mask.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“Well, we are working on that,” Zampini said on a video call with journalists.\\n\\nThe Vatican established its mask mandate in early October, just as Italy adopted a similar rule. Italy has since taken other steps that have less relevance to the Vatican, such as cutting down on nightlife. One Vatican official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to freely discuss the Holy See’s response, said the city-state was implementing a range of measures to reduce the winter health threat, including providing flu shots for residents and employees.\\n\\nThe Vatican has been turning events that would normally have major, international crowds into private or limited gatherings — an approach that will probably continue into Christmas.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut part of the trouble for the Vatican, and for the pope, is that cases in Rome can easily spill over. For all the cardinals who live full-time inside the Vatican walls, a coterie of assistants and employees come and go, taking buses and eating in Roman restaurants.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“Most people who come to the Vatican are employees who come in and out every day,” the official said. “They live the reality of the city.”\\n\\nAccording to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University, the Vatican has registered 27 coronavirus cases since the beginning of the pandemic. One of the people infected in the second wave was Dario Viganò, 58, a vice chancellor inside the Pontifical Academies of Sciences.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nViganò’s case was miserable but not severe. He said that in late September he came down with a fever and, soon after, was helped into an ambulance by two health workers in protective suits. He didn’t stay at the hospital long and instead returned to his Vatican apartment, where he lives alone. He had a fever for four or five days. Acquaintances dropped off groceries and cakes. Viganò said that Vatican health workers checked in by phone twice a day and that he monitored his own oxygen levels.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHe remained isolated for 30 days, until he tested negative, and when he did, he at last had a long walk — leaving the Vatican walls, crossing the Tiber River and heading into the center of Rome.\\n\\nAs far as Viganò understands, the infection didn’t spread.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“They reconstructed all the meetings I had up to 10 days before,” he said. “I gave them names, surnames and mobile phones for everybody. They were all contacted and all negative.”\\n\\nThe mystery for him is how he got it. He suspects he contracted it somewhere outside the Vatican, maybe on a bus or in a cafe.',\n",

Andrew Cuomo announced Saturday that most travelers must now get Covid-19 tests before and after arrival in the state.\\n\\nThe new policy replaces a previous advisory list of states with rising case counts from which travelers were required to quarantine for 14 days upon arriving in New York, the governor told reporters.\\n\\n\"Thanksgiving is going to be complicated,\" said Cuomo, adding that college students will be returning home and families getting together.\\n\\n\"People think they are safe if they are with people they know. Just because they\\'re your family doesn\\'t mean they\\'re safe from Covid.\"\\n\\nMost travelers to New York State will be required to obtain a negative Covid-19 test within three days of arriving in the state, Cuomo said.\\n\\nThe policy, which goes into effect Wednesday, does not apply to travel between New York and the neighboring states of Connecticut, New Jersey, or Pennsylvania.\\n\\nOnce in New York, travelers will be required to quarantine for three days before getting another test. If the second test is negative, the traveler will no longer be required to quarantine.\\n\\n\"If the test says you\\'re positive, then you remain in quarantine,\" Cuomo said. \"If you choose not to get tested, then you remain in quarantine for the 14-day period.\"\\n\\nNew York resident traveling outside the state for more than 24 hours must follow the same procedure.\\n\\nA New York resident leaving the state for less than 24 hours will only be required to take the second test.\\n\\nState officials said the new requirement will be enforced in the same way as the previous 14-day quarantine policy, with travelers being asked to fill out questionnaires. The policy leans on individual compliance.\\n\\nNew York\\'s overall coronavirus positivity rate Saturday was 1.49%, down from 1.53% the previous day.\\n\\nNew York maintained a seven-day moving average of new cases below 1,000 for 114 straight days -- from early June to the end of September, according to data released by Johns Hopkins University.

       "  'text': '(CNN) With less than three days to go in a campaign that\\'s been dominated by the pandemic, President Donald Trump is still making baseless statements about the pandemic, including the politically perilous claim that American doctors are profiting from Covid-19 deaths during a visit to the critical electoral region of the Midwest, where former Vice President Biden offered a contrasting message about unity and promised a more forceful response to defeat the virus.\\n\\nThe clashing messages of the two candidates stood in stark contrast as they campaigned in crucial states this weekend, each attempting to broaden his own potential path to 270 electoral votes . With swings through the Midwest and Pennsylvania, Trump and Biden are now vying for those pivotal blue-collar voters who abandoned Democrats four years ago to choose Trump\\'s outsider message.\\n\\nTrump\\'s appalling attack on doctors on Friday came on a day when the US marked a new global record for daily coronavirus cases and 17 states were seeing record hospitalizations. Instead of addressing those challenges, the President tried to explain the mounting US case count by making the false claim in Michigan that US doctors are inflating coronavirus case numbers because they \"get more money if someone dies from Covid.\"\\n\\n\"Our doctors are very smart people. So what they do is they say, \\'I\\'m sorry but everybody dies of Covid,\\' \" Trump said at a rally in Waterford Township, Michigan, on Friday. Unearthing conspiracy theories from the bowels of the Internet, the President claimed with no evidence that doctors from other countries list underlying diseases as the cause of death, while US doctors choose coronavirus.\\n\\n\"With us, when in doubt -- choose Covid,\" Trump said. \"Now they\\'ll say \\'Oh that\\'s terrible what he said,\\' but that\\'s true. It\\'s like $2,000 more, so you get more money.\"\\n\\nCampaigning with Biden in Michigan Saturday, former President Barack Obama was sharply critical of Trump\\'s comments about doctors — and incredulous that attack was part of the President\\'s closing argument.\\n\\n\"He\\'s jealous of Covid\\'s media coverage and now he\\'s accusing doctors of profiting off this pandemic—think about that,\" Obama said. \"He cannot fathom, he does not understand the notion that somebody would risk their life to save others without trying to make a buck.\"\\n\\n\"If Trump were focused on Covid from the beginning, cases wouldn\\'t be reaching new record highs across the country,\" Obama added, noting that some areas where Trump has held rallies have seen spikes in cases \"after he leaves town\" and mocking Trump\\'s \"obsession\" with crowd size in the midst of a pandemic.\\n\\n\"You know when a country is going through a pandemic that\\'s not what you\\'re supposed to be worrying about,\" Obama said. \"And that\\'s the difference between Joe Biden and Trump right there. Trump cares about feeding his ego. Joe cares about keeping you and your family safe. And he\\'s less interested in feeding his ego with having big crowds than he is making sure he\\'s not going around making more and more people sick. That\\'s what you should expect from a president.\"\\n\\nObama and Biden spent the day together in Michigan on Saturday, where Trump -- who narrowly won the state in 2016 -- had been the day before. Biden leads Trump 53% to 41% in Michigan, according to a CNN poll released Saturday, which is a wider margin than most public polling there, but the results for each candidate are within the survey\\'s margin of error of the average estimated support for that candidate.\\n\\nEven with some voters drifting away from the President because they disapprove of his handling of the virus, he has continued to insist on holding huge rallies — including four in Pennsylvania on Saturday alone — which only draws attention to the fact that he is dangerously flouting the safety guidelines of his own experts at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, daring Americans to hold him accountable for it on Election Day.\\n\\nDuring his first Pennsylvania stop Saturday, Trump continued to downplay the impact of the coronavirus on the nation, noting that he and first lady Melania Trump recovered -- without acknowledging that they received the highest caliber of medical care in the country and that he had access to experimental treatments that are not available to most Americans.\\n\\nUnderplaying the grave risk of the virus to Americans with pre-existing conditions, Trump falsely claimed that \"because of our relentless efforts, the recovery rate right now on Covid, or China virus, or the China plague, is 99.7%,\" using a racist term to describe the virus.\\n\\nNot only did Trump ignore the thousands of Americans who have died from the virus, but there is not enough data yet to understand the long-term consequences on patients who have contracted the disease. Trump, who pledged to \"terminate\" the virus with \"science, medicine and groundbreaking therapies,\" was also critical of Biden\\'s relentless focus on Covid-19 during his visit to Pennsylvania Saturday.\\n\\n\"All he does is talk about Covid, Covid,\" Trump said of Biden in Bucks County. \"He has nothing else to talk about.... We agree it\\'s serious and we\\'ve done an incredible job. And at some point they are going to recognize that.\"\\n\\nTrump\\'s claims about profiteering doctors sparked a backlash beyond the campaign trail. Susan Bailey, the president of the American Medical Association, said in a statement that the claim that doctors are overcounting Covid-19 patients or \"lying to line their pockets is a malicious, outrageous, and completely misguided charge.\"\\n\\n\"Covid-19 cases are at record highs today,\" Bailey said as Friday marked the highest single day of cases in the United States since the pandemic began. \"Rather than attacking us and lobbing baseless charges at physicians, our leaders should be following the science and urging adherence to the public health steps we know work -- wearing a mask, washing hands and practicing physical distancing.\"\\n\\nEmergency physician and former Baltimore Health Commissioner Dr. Leana Wen told CNN\\'s Wolf Blitzer on Friday night that doctors are risking their lives at a time when one person is now being diagnosed with Covid-19 every second.\\n\\n\"We have one American dying of coronavirus every two minutes, and that number is increasing,\" Wen said on \"The Situation Room.\" \"In some states, one in two people who are getting tested are testing positive. That means that we\\'re not doing nearly enough testing, and that every person who tests positive is a canary in a coal mine.\"\\n\\nWen added that there are likely to be \"many more dozens of other cases that we\\'re not detecting, and that escalation is going to increase in the weeks to come.\"\\n\\nTrump rails against nation\\'s Covid-19 focus\\n\\nThe angry tone of Trump\\'s rallies and his attacks on doctors stem in part from his frustration that the country is so focused on the pandemic in the closing days of the election. Poll after poll has shown that coronavirus is the top issue on the minds of American voters and a broad majority of the electorate disapproves of Trump\\'s handling of the virus.\\n\\nWhile Trump has gotten away with holding large rallies in other states, Minnesota has been particularly vigilant both with enforcement and contact tracing, and Trump lashed out on Friday at Minnesota officials who curtailed the size of his rally due to safety concerns.\\n\\nThe Minnesota Department of Health reported three Covid-19 outbreaks related to Trump campaign events held in the state in September. The state\\'s health department has linked at least 23 cases to Trump campaign rallies with the President in Bemidji and Duluth and a rally with Vice President Mike Pence in Minneapolis, according to information the department provided to CNN in an email last week.\\n\\nBut dismissing safety concerns as irrelevant, Trump argued that state officials, including Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, a Democrat, have created two sets of standards — one for the protesters who demonstrated against police brutality after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May and a different set for his supporters.\\n\\n\"Keith Ellison sided with flag burning extremists over law-abiding Americans. He treats you like second-class citizens,\" Trump said in Rochester, Minnesota, on Friday night where state officials limited the crowd to 250 people. \"He believes that the pro-American voters have fewer rights than anti-American demonstrators.\"\\n\\nAs part of that argument, Trump once again conflated Black Lives Matter demonstrations, which were largely peaceful across the country this year, with the far smaller number of protests that turned violent and have served as a helpful foil as he tries to argue that Biden would coddle criminals while fomenting what he described as \"vile anti-police rhetoric.\"\\n\\nSpeaking in Falcon Heights, a suburb of St. Paul, Biden refuted that argument by zeroing in on the difference between peaceful protesters and violent agitators who took advantage of this year\\'s movement for racial justice.\\n\\n\"Burning and looting is not protesting, it\\'s violence clear and simple -- and will not be tolerated,\" Biden said at his event, which he said was seven miles from where Floyd was killed by a police officer. \"But these protests are a cry for justice.\"\\n\\nThe former vice president argued that Trump\\'s divisive language about the protests and his effort to pit Americans \"against one another based on race, gender, ethnicity and national origin\" are part of an effort to distract from his handling of the pandemic.\\n\\nDuring his final event of the day in Milwaukee on Friday, Biden noted that the state is now experiencing a record level of coronavirus hospitalizations.\\n\\n\"This week, Wisconsin, like other states, set a new record for daily cases. Hospitals are running short on beds, just had to open a field hospital. That\\'s what we\\'re facing. We\\'ve now hit 9 million cases,\" Biden said Friday night. \"Millions of people out of work; on the edge and they can\\'t see the light. They\\'re not sure how dark it\\'s going to remain ... and the thing that bothers me the most was a President who gave up.\"',\n",

Hale will act as a poll chaplain in Georgia, a state that was at the center of a debate over voter suppression during the 2018 midterms.\\n\\nIn a tumultuous election year in which there are heightened fears about voter intimidation and suppression, these poll chaplains hope to ensure that every vote gets counted. They have been trained to provide information to voters about their rights, and deescalate any conflicts that may arise at polling locations.\\n\\n“In Georgia in particular, we have some real concerns about voter intimidation and voter suppression,” Hale said. “Some of these can be handled easily, you know, people not having the right ID, or something of that nature.”\\n\\nHale added: “So to be a poll chaplain is to be there as a clergy person giving people, in most instances, comfort, because they trust clergy people, and letting them know that there is someone there to support and help them. We're not there to get in the way of the process at all.”\\n\\nHale is the founder and senior pastor of the Ray of Hope Christian Church, which doubles as her polling location. Prior to joining this church, Hale said she was the first woman to serve in an all-male federal prison as a chaplain in North Carolina.\\n\\nIn addition to the poll chaplains, the group set up a hotline to make lawyers available to identify and address any voting irregularities and intimidation that may occur throughout the voting process.\\n\\nAround the US: Lawyers and Collars is the product of a partnership between Sojourners, Skinner Leadership Institute, and the National African American Clergy Network. The lawyers and poll chaplains will be located throughout Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\\n\\nBishop Claude Alexander, a poll chaplain and pastor in Charlotte, North Carolina, told CNN, “We are still having incidences of suppression, where people are being intimidated, and they are actually being told, ‘Go away, you cannot vote here.’ And therefore, there has to be some counter-presence that helps redirect and then give assurance to those individuals.”\",\n",

       "  'text': '(CNN) With less than three days to go in a campaign that\\'s been dominated by the pandemic, President Donald Trump is still making baseless statements about the pandemic, including the politically perilous claim that American doctors are profiting from Covid-19 deaths during a visit to the critical electoral region of the Midwest, where former Vice President Biden offered a contrasting message about unity and promised a more forceful response to defeat the virus.\\n\\nThe clashing messages of the two candidates stood in stark contrast as they campaigned in crucial states this weekend, each attempting to broaden his own potential path to 270 electoral votes . With swings through the Midwest and Pennsylvania, Trump and Biden are now vying for those pivotal blue-collar voters who abandoned Democrats four years ago to choose Trump\\'s outsider message.\\n\\nTrump\\'s appalling attack on doctors on Friday came on a day when the US marked a new global record for daily coronavirus cases and 17 states were seeing record hospitalizations. Instead of addressing those challenges, the President tried to explain the mounting US case count by making the false claim in Michigan that US doctors are inflating coronavirus case numbers because they \"get more money if someone dies from Covid.\"\\n\\n\"Our doctors are very smart people. So what they do is they say, \\'I\\'m sorry but everybody dies of Covid,\\' \" Trump said at a rally in Waterford Township, Michigan, on Friday. Unearthing conspiracy theories from the bowels of the Internet, the President claimed with no evidence that doctors from other countries list underlying diseases as the cause of death, while US doctors choose coronavirus.\\n\\n\"With us, when in doubt -- choose Covid,\" Trump said. \"Now they\\'ll say \\'Oh that\\'s terrible what he said,\\' but that\\'s true. It\\'s like $2,000 more, so you get more money.\"\\n\\nCampaigning with Biden in Michigan Saturday, former President Barack Obama was sharply critical of Trump\\'s comments about doctors — and incredulous that attack was part of the President\\'s closing argument.\\n\\n\"He\\'s jealous of Covid\\'s media coverage and now he\\'s accusing doctors of profiting off this pandemic—think about that,\" Obama said. \"He cannot fathom, he does not understand the notion that somebody would risk their life to save others without trying to make a buck.\"\\n\\n\"If Trump were focused on Covid from the beginning, cases wouldn\\'t be reaching new record highs across the country,\" Obama added, noting that some areas where Trump has held rallies have seen spikes in cases \"after he leaves town\" and mocking Trump\\'s \"obsession\" with crowd size in the midst of a pandemic.\\n\\n\"You know when a country is going through a pandemic that\\'s not what you\\'re supposed to be worrying about,\" Obama said. \"And that\\'s the difference between Joe Biden and Trump right there. Trump cares about feeding his ego. Joe cares about keeping you and your family safe. And he\\'s less interested in feeding his ego with having big crowds than he is making sure he\\'s not going around making more and more people sick. That\\'s what you should expect from a president.\"\\n\\nObama and Biden spent the day together in Michigan on Saturday, where Trump -- who narrowly won the state in 2016 -- had been the day before. Biden leads Trump 53% to 41% in Michigan, according to a CNN poll released Saturday, which is a wider margin than most public polling there, but the results for each candidate are within the survey\\'s margin of error of the average estimated support for that candidate.\\n\\nEven with some voters drifting away from the President because they disapprove of his handling of the virus, he has continued to insist on holding huge rallies — including four in Pennsylvania on Saturday alone — which only draws attention to the fact that he is dangerously flouting the safety guidelines of his own experts at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, daring Americans to hold him accountable for it on Election Day.\\n\\nDuring his first Pennsylvania stop Saturday, Trump continued to downplay the impact of the coronavirus on the nation, noting that he and first lady Melania Trump recovered -- without acknowledging that they received the highest caliber of medical care in the country and that he had access to experimental treatments that are not available to most Americans.\\n\\nUnderplaying the grave risk of the virus to Americans with pre-existing conditions, Trump falsely claimed that \"because of our relentless efforts, the recovery rate right now on Covid, or China virus, or the China plague, is 99.7%,\" using a racist term to describe the virus.\\n\\nNot only did Trump ignore the thousands of Americans who have died from the virus, but there is not enough data yet to understand the long-term consequences on patients who have contracted the disease. Trump, who pledged to \"terminate\" the virus with \"science, medicine and groundbreaking therapies,\" was also critical of Biden\\'s relentless focus on Covid-19 during his visit to Pennsylvania Saturday.\\n\\n\"All he does is talk about Covid, Covid,\" Trump said of Biden in Bucks County. \"He has nothing else to talk about.... We agree it\\'s serious and we\\'ve done an incredible job. And at some point they are going to recognize that.\"\\n\\nTrump\\'s claims about profiteering doctors sparked a backlash beyond the campaign trail. Susan Bailey, the president of the American Medical Association, said in a statement that the claim that doctors are overcounting Covid-19 patients or \"lying to line their pockets is a malicious, outrageous, and completely misguided charge.\"\\n\\n\"Covid-19 cases are at record highs today,\" Bailey said as Friday marked the highest single day of cases in the United States since the pandemic began. \"Rather than attacking us and lobbing baseless charges at physicians, our leaders should be following the science and urging adherence to the public health steps we know work -- wearing a mask, washing hands and practicing physical distancing.\"\\n\\nEmergency physician and former Baltimore Health Commissioner Dr. Leana Wen told CNN\\'s Wolf Blitzer on Friday night that doctors are risking their lives at a time when one person is now being diagnosed with Covid-19 every second.\\n\\n\"We have one American dying of coronavirus every two minutes, and that number is increasing,\" Wen said on \"The Situation Room.\" \"In some states, one in two people who are getting tested are testing positive. That means that we\\'re not doing nearly enough testing, and that every person who tests positive is a canary in a coal mine.\"\\n\\nWen added that there are likely to be \"many more dozens of other cases that we\\'re not detecting, and that escalation is going to increase in the weeks to come.\"\\n\\nTrump rails against nation\\'s Covid-19 focus\\n\\nThe angry tone of Trump\\'s rallies and his attacks on doctors stem in part from his frustration that the country is so focused on the pandemic in the closing days of the election. Poll after poll has shown that coronavirus is the top issue on the minds of American voters and a broad majority of the electorate disapproves of Trump\\'s handling of the virus.\\n\\nWhile Trump has gotten away with holding large rallies in other states, Minnesota has been particularly vigilant both with enforcement and contact tracing, and Trump lashed out on Friday at Minnesota officials who curtailed the size of his rally due to safety concerns.\\n\\nThe Minnesota Department of Health reported three Covid-19 outbreaks related to Trump campaign events held in the state in September. The state\\'s health department has linked at least 23 cases to Trump campaign rallies with the President in Bemidji and Duluth and a rally with Vice President Mike Pence in Minneapolis, according to information the department provided to CNN in an email last week.\\n\\nBut dismissing safety concerns as irrelevant, Trump argued that state officials, including Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, a Democrat, have created two sets of standards — one for the protesters who demonstrated against police brutality after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May and a different set for his supporters.\\n\\n\"Keith Ellison sided with flag burning extremists over law-abiding Americans. He treats you like second-class citizens,\" Trump said in Rochester, Minnesota, on Friday night where state officials limited the crowd to 250 people. \"He believes that the pro-American voters have fewer rights than anti-American demonstrators.\"\\n\\nAs part of that argument, Trump once again conflated Black Lives Matter demonstrations, which were largely peaceful across the country this year, with the far smaller number of protests that turned violent and have served as a helpful foil as he tries to argue that Biden would coddle criminals while fomenting what he described as \"vile anti-police rhetoric.\"\\n\\nSpeaking in Falcon Heights, a suburb of St. Paul, Biden refuted that argument by zeroing in on the difference between peaceful protesters and violent agitators who took advantage of this year\\'s movement for racial justice.\\n\\n\"Burning and looting is not protesting, it\\'s violence clear and simple -- and will not be tolerated,\" Biden said at his event, which he said was seven miles from where Floyd was killed by a police officer. \"But these protests are a cry for justice.\"\\n\\nThe former vice president argued that Trump\\'s divisive language about the protests and his effort to pit Americans \"against one another based on race, gender, ethnicity and national origin\" are part of an effort to distract from his handling of the pandemic.\\n\\nDuring his final event of the day in Milwaukee on Friday, Biden noted that the state is now experiencing a record level of coronavirus hospitalizations.\\n\\n\"This week, Wisconsin, like other states, set a new record for daily cases. Hospitals are running short on beds, just had to open a field hospital. That\\'s what we\\'re facing. We\\'ve now hit 9 million cases,\" Biden said Friday night. \"Millions of people out of work; on the edge and they can\\'t see the light. They\\'re not sure how dark it\\'s going to remain ... and the thing that bothers me the most was a President who gave up.\"',\n",

       "  'text': 'Karen Bass is the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus and is serving her fifth term representing California\\'s 37th Congressional District. The opinions expressed here are her own. Read more opinion at CNN.\\n\\n(CNN) In the eight months since the Covid-19 pandemic exploded across the United States, more than 9 million Americans have been infected and more than 230,000 have died, according to Johns Hopkins University. Yet President Donald Trump still doesn\\'t have a science-based plan to bring the virus under control.\\n\\nIndeed, the President has sidelined scientists and experts in favor of relying on his latest adviser and member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, Dr. Scott Atlas. Atlas, a radiologist who is neither an infectious disease expert nor an epidemiologist, has reportedly made supportive comments about a controversial \"herd immunity\" approach, which would let the virus run its course while somehow isolating the elderly and those who are most at risk. (Atlas has recently denied these reports.)\\n\\nThe World Health Organization called the herd immunity proposal \"unethical\" and never used \"in the history of public health.\" It\\'s also scientifically incoherent . We don\\'t yet know if people who have recovered from the virus develop permanent immunity, as with chicken pox, or only temporary protection. Some patients develop long-term complications that may affect their health for months — or years — to come. And not only do we have plenty of evidence that young and healthy people can get very ill and die of Covid-19, we also know that there is no way to isolate the most vulnerable, since infections among young adults can easily spread to senior citizens.\\n\\nAs the US climbs toward its third peak of infections, make no mistake: If Donald Trump is reelected, he\\'ll continue to dismiss and downplay the pandemic. And with a \"herd immunity\" approach, as it\\'s been reported the White House has discussed, more than 200 million Americans could get sick and more than 2 million could die\\n\\nFurthermore, without targeted policy changes, we can expect Covid-19 to continue to have a disproportionate impact on people of color. Black Americans, Latinos, and Native Americans continue to be about 5 times more likely to be hospitalized than whites. Estimates indicate that a staggering 78% of American children who have died in the pandemic have been children of color. All told, about 1 in every 920 Black Americans has died of Covid-19 so far this year, according to a data analysis by APM Research Lab.\\n\\nAll of which forces us to ask: If this virus wasn\\'t disproportionately affecting people of color, would the White House handle this the same way it has so far? If 1 in 1,000 White Americans had died of Covid-19, would the White House be sitting on unspent money allocated by Congress that could be used to make testing free and widely available?\\n\\nThe clear answer is no — because the Trump Administration\\'s position has been consistent from their first day in office. President Trump, his advisers, and his Republican allies in Congress have sought every opportunity to penalize, punish, and persecute the most vulnerable among us, and especially vulnerable people of color, across every dimension of their policy agenda. In other words, having no Covid-19 plan is the President\\'s plan — because of who is dying.\\n\\nForget compassionate conservatism. Today\\'s Republican Party is the party of caveman conservatism. Consider food aid. Having been blocked repeatedly from cutting food stamps by Democrats in Congress, the Trump Department of Agriculture is pursuing regulatory changes that would end Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits for more than 3 million people, and reduce benefits for 7 million more. If not for a recent federal judicial ruling, 700,000 unemployed Americans would have lost food assistance during the pandemic and a historic recession.\\n\\nAnd not only has President Trump held Covid-19 super spreader events — including at the White House itself — his administration is fighting in court right now to get rid of the Affordable Care Act in its entirety. If they win, the millions of Americans who have preexisting conditions — including those who recover from Covid-19 — could be denied coverage or be forced to pay higher rates.\\n\\nAlmost the entire Republican Party is in lockstep with the President\\'s vision. We weren\\'t even a month into the pandemic when the Republican lieutenant governor of Texas said that older Americans might be willing to die to protect the economy. In 2017, Republican Rep. Roger Marshall said that low-income Americans are \"a group of people that just don\\'t want health care and aren\\'t going to take care of themselves.\" He later said he didn\\'t mean to suggest poor people take their health care for granted.\\n\\nAnd the President\\'s son-in-law Jared Kushner — also a senior White House adviser — insinuated in an interview on Fox News last Monday that Black people don\\'t \"want to be successful.\\'\\n\\nTaken all together, the Republican Party\\'s approach to every issue begins to look a lot like social Darwinism. In the circular logic of that discredited social theory, there is no such thing as being a victim of circumstance or systemic injustice. If you are deserving, you will manage to claw your way to the top of the heap. If you are not already at the top, you are a de facto loser who doesn\\'t deserve the government\\'s help. It\\'s everyone for themselves.\\n\\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion\\'s new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\\n\\nThat approach might work in an Ayn Rand novel, but it doesn\\'t work in the real world. The pandemic has made that plain. Unmasked college students can get grandparents sick. A wedding with 62 guests can trigger a statewide spread of the virus. And despite crowing that Covid-19 meant he would no longer have to shake hands with his supporters — who former Trump White House official Olivia Troye said he called disgusting people \" — the President, the first lady, and dozens of staff and prominent Republicans still got infected.\\n\\nMore than eight decades ago, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt said, \"The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little.\" Donald Trump and the Republican Party have failed that test time and time again. It\\'s up to the American people to set a new course — before it\\'s too late for millions of us.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Joe Lockhart is a CNN political analyst. He was the White House press secretary from 1998-2000 in President Bill Clinton\\'s administration. He co-hosts the podcast \"Words Matter.\" The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.\\n\\n(CNN) Although the result of the presidential election remains in the balance, there is no doubt in my mind President Donald Trump has run a historically bad campaign. At the root of his problem was his decision to put politics ahead of good policy. Case in point: failing to mobilize a national effort to fight the pandemic because he thought that owning the responsibility for a public health crisis was bad politics.\\n\\nIn making that judgment, the President actually squandered the most powerful weapon an incumbent has in his arsenal -- the awesome power of the presidency and the ability to set the national agenda. By pretending Covid-19 would go away and dodging any responsibility for the deaths of more than 230,000 Americans, the President put himself on the defense for the entire campaign.\\n\\nSo, what should he have done? First and foremost, he should have listened to and empowered the scientists and public health officials to lead the way. No one expects the President to go into a lab and come up with a cure himself. What they do expect is for a president to do everything he can to empower scientists to do their jobs. Instead, Trump spewed a near-constant stream of lies, thwarted infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci\\'s ability to hammer home public health guidance, and undermined faith in the vaccine development process. At every turn, Trump has only made it harder for scientists to fight the raging pandemic. Despite the President\\'s efforts to rush a vaccine through \"Operation Warp Speed,\" the country is still reeling from a surge in Covid cases.\\n\\nSecond, he should taken full responsibility for the fight against the coronavirus. Even if he wasn\\'t motivated by doing the right thing, it would have been politically savvy to step up to the plate. This is a national crisis, and the public will always hold the President responsible. By shifting the blame to the governors, the President looked weak and lost any real ability to take credit for the fight against the virus. \"We want the states to administer these tests, for the most part,\" Trump said . \"We want them to do it, we\\'re not going to be running a parking lot in Arkansas.\"\\n\\nPolitically, there is nothing more powerful for an incumbent President than to lead a national effort, bring the country together and demonstrate on a daily basis the awesome power of the presidency and the US government.\\n\\nThird, the President should have modeled good behavior. It quickly became apparent to the scientists that the most powerful defense against the virus for all Americans was staying home, social distancing, and wearing a mask. Clearly, these involved making personal sacrifices for the greater good. Trump, however, believed it was bad politics to ask people to modify their behavior and he defied his own public health experts almost from the start. Leaders like former President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and UK Prime Minister Winston Churchill drew great political power by speaking to the force of a country that comes together to face an existential challenge. Can you imagine either of these leaders saying food rationing or converting industries in the war effort was an infringement on personal liberty?\\n\\nFourth, the President has executive emergency powers to mobilize resources from all corners of America. Trump likes to act like a strongman, but when it came time to wield power of the Defense Production Act, it seemed Trump was suddenly gun-shy. Instead of mounting an organized effort to source and produce medical equipment, Trump mostly sat on his hands, downplayed the risk of the virus, and turned down the opportunity to embody a wartime president.\\n\\nUltimately, the biggest miscalculation the President made was hoping the problem would just go away. He completely mismanaged the expectations of the American people by consistently telling them things were going to improve -- despite evidence to the contrary. For 15 consecutive days, Trump said we were \"rounding the curve\" in defeating the virus, despite the fact that infections were spiking -- and still are -- to record levels. He also boasted that the virus \"is going to disappear. One day it\\'s like a miracle, it will disappear.\"\\n\\nWhen the virus refused to go away, Trump insisted on sticking to this alternate reality he created. Taking charge, setting expectations, mobilizing resources and empowering scientists would have made a world\\'s difference. But the President didn\\'t do any of these things. His strategy was to deflect and deny responsibility by blaming others. In doing so, he squandered the power of his office and fundamentally misunderstood the American public\\'s ability to work together under the right leadership.\\n\\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion\\'s new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\\n\\nWhen I worked in the White House, former President Bill Clinton used to tell us all the time that good policy always makes for good politics, not the other way around. Clinton also understood the American public knew a president could not solve every problem. But they expected him to try, and to use every resource available to meet the challenge.\\n\\nTrump has served himself poorly by ignoring this political lesson. Had he taken a more aggressive approach, owned the problem and demonstrated that he was doing everything he could, I suspect he would not be in the precarious position he finds himself today. Put another way, if he acted presidential and did the job of president, it might not be such a close race.',\n",

Augusto Zampini, acknowledged Tuesday that at age 83 and with part of his lung removed after an illness in his youth, Francis would be at high risk for complications if he were to become infected.\\n\\nPope Francis shares a word with Monsignor Luis Maria Rodrigo Ewart as he arrives in the Paul VI Hall at the Vatican for his weekly general audience, on Wednesday, October 28, 2020. Alessandra Tarantino / AP\\n\\nZampini said he hoped Francis would don a mask at least when he greeted people during the general audience. \"We are working on that,\" he said.\\n\\nGet Breaking News Delivered to Your Inbox\\n\\nFrancis has only been seen wearing a mask in public twice: On Sept. 9 as he entered and exited his general audience, and last week during a two-hour interfaith prayer service in downtown Rome.\\n\\nWhile Francis\\' lung condition could explain his reluctance to wear a mask, there has been no comment from the Vatican about why protocol officials allow other people to get close to him without donning face protection. People who have had private meetings with him recently said no masks were worn and no proof of recent negative virus tests required. Vatican regulations require masks indoors and out when social distancing cannot be guaranteed.\\n\\nAt the start of the audience, Francis again apologized that he wouldn\\'t descend into the crowd to greet well-wishers because he said doing so would create a crowd around him.\\n\\n\"And this goes against the precautions we need before this lady called COVID, who does us so much harm,\" Francis said from the stage of the Vatican auditorium. \"For this reason, please forgive me that I don\\'t go down to greet you. I greet you from here and I keep you in my heart, and please keep me in your heart and pray for me.\"\\n\\nItaly, the first country in the West to be slammed by the pandemic, has seen a sharp rebound in infections in recent weeks that prompted the government to close restaurants and bars at night and shutter theaters, gyms and pools. Public health officials are urging people to stay home as much as possible.\\n\\nFrancis\\' audience — which in pre-pandemic times would draw thousands of people each week to St. Peter\\'s Square or the auditorium — featured only a few hundred people Wednesday.\\n\\nIn August, Francis warned against any prospect that rich people would get priority for a coronavirus vaccine. \"The pandemic is a crisis.

Joe Burbank | Tribune News Service | Getty Images\\n\\nCellular, or \"T-cell,\" immunity against Covid-19 is likely to be present within most adults six months after primary infection, a new study said. Research by the U.K. Coronavirus Immunology Consortium (UK-CIC), Public Health England and Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust has found \"robust T-cell responses\" to the coronavirus six months after infection. T-cells are a part of our immune system that attack cells which have been infected with a virus or other kind of pathogen and they help other antibody-producing cells in the immune system. Scientists have been investigating T-cell responses to the coronavirus to see how lasting any immune response might be in individuals who have caught, and recovered from, Covid-19.\\n\\nThis latest study looked at 100 individuals who had tested positive for the coronavirus in March and April of 2020 but had not been hospitalized with the virus. All 100 individuals had experienced either mild or moderate symptoms or were asymptomatic (56 versus 44 people), the study noted. Serum samples were collected monthly to measure antibody levels, and blood samples were taken after six months to assess the cellular (T-cell) response to the virus. A range of analyses were carried out to assess different aspects of the T-cell response including the magnitude of response and the response to different proteins from the virus, the study noted. \"T-cell responses were present in all individuals at six months after SARS-CoV-2 infection,\" it said, indicating \"that a robust cellular memory against the virus persists for at least six months.\" The study found, however, that \"the size of T-cell response differed between individuals, being considerably (50%) higher in people who had experienced symptomatic disease at the time of infection six months previously.\" The study has not yet been published in a medical journal or peer-reviewed.\\n\\nPiece of the Covid-19 puzzle',\n",

       "  'text': '(CNN) If you think a negative test result means you don\\'t have coronavirus, you could be wrong.\\n\\nIt can take days before a new infection shows up on a Covid-19 test.\\n\\n\"We know that the incubation period for Covid-19 is up to 14 days. And before that, you can be testing negative, and have no symptoms,\" emergency medicine physician Dr. Leana Wen told CNN. \"But you could actually be harboring the virus and be able to transmit it to others.\"\\n\\nSo if you want to get tested as a precaution before seeing friends or family, here\\'s what you need to know:\\n\\nIf I got infected yesterday, would a test today pick that up?\\n\\nProbably not. A study in the medical journal Annals of Internal Medicine examined false-negative test results of people who actually had Covid-19\\n\\nThe study estimated that during four days of infection before symptoms typically started, the probability of getting an incorrect/negative test result on Day 1 was 100%\\n\\nOn the day people started showing symptoms, the average false-negative rate had dropped to 38%, according to the study. Three days after symptoms started, the false-negative rate dropped to 20%.\\n\\n\"The virus just takes time to replicate in the body to detectable levels,\" said Justin Lessler, a senior author of the study and associate professor of epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.\\n\\n\"You can get infected by just a few viral particles, but these will not be detectable until they have time to replicate to adequate levels to be detected,\" he told CNN by email.\\n\\nSo how many days should a person wait after possible exposure to get tested?\\n\\n\"There is no hard and fast rule, but the evidence suggests getting a test before the third day after exposure is not of much use,\" Lessler said.\\n\\nCould I be contagious while testing negative?\\n\\nAbsolutely. \"People sort of feel like if you test (negative), you\\'re out of the woods. And you\\'re kind of not,\" said Dr. Rochelle Walensky, chief of the infectious diseases division at Massachusetts General Hospital.\\n\\nFor people who get sick with Covid-19, symptoms can take up to two weeks to appear, but the average time is about five days, Walensky said.\\n\\n\"It\\'s generally thought that you\\'re most infectious the two days before that day and the two days after that,\" she said.\\n\\nOne reason why this virus spreads so easily is because people can be infectious without any symptoms. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 40% of infections are asymptomatic, and 50% of transmissions happen before symptoms begin.\\n\\n\"It\\'s been among the biggest Achilles\\' heels of this. And it\\'s been among the biggest challenges and the unexpected things because (with) its cousins, this is not true,\" Walensky said.\\n\\n\"The reason we were able to control the SARS outbreak so quickly -- although there were obviously a lot of deaths there -- but it didn\\'t turn into a pandemic is because people weren\\'t shedding (the virus) until they got symptoms.\"\\n\\nDo different kinds of Covid-19 tests matter?\\n\\nWhen it comes to diagnostic tests -- those that detect whether you have an active coronavirus infection -- there are two main types:\\n\\nMolecular tests, such as PCR tests, look for the virus\\' genetic material. Most of these tests are performed with nasal swabs or throat swabs, though some can be done using saliva, the , such as PCR tests, look for the virus\\' genetic material. Most of these tests are performed with nasal swabs or throat swabs, though some can be done using saliva, the US Food and Drug Administration says.\\n\\n\"This test is typically highly accurate and usually does not need to be repeated,\" the FDA says.\\n\\nBut the downside to molecular testing is that results can take a while -- anywhere from the same day to one week after testing.\\n\\n\"For people who show symptoms, so far the studies show the accuracy of the molecular test to find a positive case increases with each day after the exposure,\" said Pia MacDonald, infectious disease epidemiologist at the nonprofit research institute RTI International.\\n\\nBut for infected people who don\\'t get symptoms, the accuracy rates are less clear, she said. \"Molecular test performance studies on asymptomatic people are very limited.\"\\n\\nAntigen tests don\\'t look for the virus\\' genetic material, like molecular tests do. Instead, they look for specific proteins on the surface of the virus.\\n\\nThe good news is you can get antigen test results in less than an hour. The bad news is you\\'re more likely to get a false negative with a rapid antigen test.\\n\\n\"Positive results are usually highly accurate but negative results may need to be confirmed with a molecular test,\" the FDA says.\\n\\n\"Antigen tests are more likely to miss an active coronavirus infection compared to molecular tests.\"\\n\\nThis could help explain some of the recent spread of Covid-19 linked to the White House.\\n\\nRegardless of which type of diagnostic test you use, you\\'re generally more likely to get a false negative than a false positive.\\n\\n\"If a molecular test is positive, it\\'s an accurate reflection of a person being infected,\" MacDonald said. \"If it\\'s negative, it\\'s less reliable that the person is indeed negative. The same is true of the antigen tests.\"\\n\\nCan I test myself at home?\\n\\nUsers take their own nasal swab samples and mail them to a lab, which will send results digitally within 24 to 48 hours of receiving the samples. Yes. There are some at-home testing kits available, such at the Everlywell Covid-19 molecular test Users take their own nasal swab samples and mail them to a lab, which will send results digitally within 24 to 48 hours of receiving the samples.\\n\\nBut taking any kind of Covid-19 test too early might miss an infection, said Dr. Frank Ong, chief medical and scientific officer at Everlywell.\\n\\n\"As testing capacity has continued to increase, more and more asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic individuals have undergone testing, most of whom likely have lower viral loads in their clinical samples,\" he said.\\n\\n\"My best advice is to treat yourself as if you are likely infected after suspected exposure. Quarantine, wear a mask to cover both nose and mouth, and practice good hygiene practices. If you want to take extra precautions or you believe you may have been exposed, get tested for the virus using an FDA-authorized test for Covid-19.\"\\n\\nSo what should I do if I want to see friends or relatives?\\n\\nIf you insist on seeing loved ones for Thanksgiving, self-quarantining for 14 days beforehand is probably your safest bet, Walensky said.\\n\\n\"A 14-day quarantine -- with a real quarantine -- if you do that properly, you don\\'t need a test,\" she said. \"That\\'s probably the cleanest way to do it.\"\\n\\nTo be clear: Quarantining means staying home. It does not mean you can run errands.\\n\\n\"\\'Grocery store\\' and \\'quarantine\\' don\\'t belong in the same sentence,\" Walensky said.\\n\\nAdding testing to your list of precautions \"is a helpful thing, but only if it\\'s done properly,\" she said. \"And if you don\\'t know exactly when or how to use it, then you very well could be setting yourself up for a false sense of security.\"\\n\\nLessler agreed that quarantining is best, and testing must be done intelligently.\\n\\n\"If you are visiting an elderly family member and have a reasonable risk of having been exposed, there is no substitute for 14 days of quarantine,\" Lessler said.\\n\\n\"At the very least I would wait 10 days and have a negative test. If you are visiting a younger, healthy family member and have little chance of being exposed before or during travel, then 5 or 7 days (of quarantine) plus a negative test is probably plenty of risk reduction, though no guarantee of safety. Either way, you should definitely remain in quarantine while awaiting test results and make sure everyone you are getting together with is on the same page about the plan for controlling infection risk.\"\\n\\nThere have already been cases of coronavirus spread within families just days after a person tested negative, said Dr. Michael St. Louis, a member of the CDC\\'s Community Guidance Team.\\n\\nHe said everyone must remember to treat family from different households the same way you would treat unrelated friends or work colleagues during this pandemic.\\n\\nOf course, the best way to help ensure the safety of all your loved ones is to celebrate the holidays remotely.\\n\\n\"I have three kids. ... And my parents are not going to be joining us this year,\" Walensky said.\\n\\n\"It\\'s just awful. But what I really hold out for is that my parents are pretty healthy, and I would never forgive myself if I put them in harm\\'s way. And I\\'m just looking forward to a 2021 when we can be together.\"\\n\\nThe CDC suggests celebrating with loved ones virtually online. You can also make traditional Thanksgiving dishes and deliver them \" in a way that doesn\\'t involve contact \" to relatives, neighbors or those who might be feeling lonely.\\n\\nWalensky said the small sacrifices made this Thanksgiving will help ensure everyone will be healthy enough to sit at the table next year.\\n\\n\"At least they\\'ll be there next year, whereas irresponsible behavior now might mean they won\\'t be here later,\" she said.\\n\\n\"Let\\'s do this so that we can have a much better shot of being around the table together, healthy, in 2021.\"',\n",

Ultimately, our efforts were unsuccessful. More than 52 percent of respondents voted to keep the name as is.\\n\\nBefore this issue arose (and before we were fully aware of the offensiveness of “plantation”), we were considering moving to a new home in our community; now we are not so sure we should.

I eventually moved, too.\\n\\nRecently, I moved to yet another city and learned that he moved to the city where I had been living last, and where I still have many friends and acquaintances, particularly in the L.G.B.T. community. I know that he identifies as L.G.B.T.\\n\\nTo my knowledge, he has not assaulted anyone since I reported him to the police. He quit drinking and got married. He lost many friends and raised money for a domestic-violence organization. I developed PTSD as a result of the attack and have spent years in therapy to diminish (but not completely eliminate) my symptoms, and this led to the dissolution of my marriage at the time.

You report evidence that he’s reformed — he has given up alcohol (which is especially relevant if his drinking played a role in the attack), married, committed to public service and, perhaps, paid some cost for his behavior in lost friends.

But U.S. border agents quickly turned them back to Mexico.\\n\\nGrabriela, 13, hoped to apply for asylum when she reached the Texas border in April, just as her mother had done years earlier when she fled gangs in El Salvador. But after being apprehended by U.S. officials, the girl was detained in a hotel and then placed on a deportation flight.\\n\\nAfter waiting months in Mexico\\'s violence-plagued Ciudad Juárez for her U.S. court hearing, Elida allowed her 12-year-old son Gustavo to present himself to U.S. border officials, thinking he would be allowed to reunite with his grandfather in South Carolina. Instead, Gustavo, a largely non-verbal boy with physical and learning disabilities, was expelled to Guatemala alone.\\n\\nGet Breaking News Delivered to Your Inbox\\n\\nPrior to mid-March, these migrant children would have been housed in shelters and allowed to seek asylum or other forms of U.S. sanctuary with the help of lawyers. But their rapid expulsions from the U.S. are part of the Trump administration\\'s unprecedented efforts to use the COVID-19 pandemic as justification to sidestep legal protections for minors who arrive at America\\'s borders without documents.\\n\\nBy designating them public health threats who could spread the virus, the Trump administration has expelled at least 8,800 unaccompanied migrant children, some as young as 10, without a court hearing or asylum screening, circumventing safeguards Congress created to shield them from trafficking, exploitation and persecution.\\n\\nIn all, more than 204,000 of these expulsions have been carried out across the U.S.-Mexico border since March, according to government data.\\n\\nPresident Trump\\'s top immigration enforcement officials have portrayed the emergency policy as strictly based on public health and greenlighted by orders from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\\n\\nHowever, the White House and senior advisor Stephen Miller aggressively pressured the CDC to implement the order, bypassing objections from experts at the agency who believed there was no public health basis to invoke a 1940s law to shutter U.S. borders to migrants, including asylum-seekers and children, three former Trump administration officials familiar with the discussions told CBS News. The officials were granted anonymity in order to speak frankly about internal deliberations.\\n\\n\"We were forced to do it,\" one former official who worked on public health told CBS News. \"We exhausted all of the options. We delayed. We slow-rolled. We flat out said there\\'s not a public health justification. We said no. And then we were told, \\'Do it.\\' So, at the end of the day, your options are to resign in protest or sign it. And if you resign in protest, the next person is just going to do it anyways.\"\\n\\nA border patrol agent walks along a border wall separating Tijuana, Mexico, from San Diego, Wednesday, March 18, 2020, in San Diego. Gregory Bull / AP\\n\\nAccording to two of the former officials, career experts at the CDC\\'s Division of Global Migration and Quarantine — which would have jurisdiction over border measures to contain the virus — refused to be involved in the expulsions order. Instead, these former officials said, the order was drafted by Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) lawyer Brian Stimson, a political appointee. An HHS spokesperson said \"career and political attorneys\" who serve as lawyers for the CDC were involved because the order was a \"public health and legal matter.\"\\n\\nAfter mounting White House pressure, including a call from Vice President Mike Pence, CDC Director Robert Redfield signed the directive, which took effect on March 20. Katie Miller, a spokeswoman for Pence who is married to Miller, denied that the vice president \"directed the CDC on this issue.\"\\n\\n\"It was one of many tough choices that we were forced to make, and ultimately the White House and their preference prevailed,\" a second former public health official told CBS News. \"Public health authority had never been used in this way. A lot of folks, myself included, felt that this was a misappropriation of that authority.\"\\n\\nCDC officials initially were able to \"pare down\" the order so that it would have to be reauthorized every 30 days. In May, after two renewals, the order was extended indefinitely. A subsequent order issued last month will be in place until the CDC director determines \"the danger of further introduction of COVID-19 into the United States has ceased to be a serious danger.\"\\n\\n\"I guarantee you, under this administration, it will never happen,\" one of the former public health officials said. \"It will take a new administration, a new director to come in and say, \\'This is BS, I\\'m pulling it.\\'\"\\n\\nFor the first time, Joe Biden\\'s campaign on Sunday said the former vice president would order a review of the policy if elected. \"A Biden Administration would direct the CDC and DHS to review this policy and make the appropriate changes to ensure that people have the ability to submit their asylum claims while ensuring that we are taking the appropriate COVID-19 safety precautions, as guided by the science and public health experts,\" campaign spokesperson Pili Tobar told CBS News.\\n\\nThe Associated Press and The Wall Street Journal have also reported on the White House\\'s campaign to overrule CDC officials who opposed the border expulsions order.\\n\\nOn March 27, seven days after the CDC order took effect, Chad Mizelle, the top lawyer at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), sent a memo to Ken Cuccinelli, the second-in-command at the department, proposing to further restrict asylum eligibility based on the pandemic, according to documents obtained by the group Human Rights First under the Freedom of Information Act.\\n\\nIn a statement provided by the White House, Redfield said \"data pointed to a public health risk from COVID-19 to the illegal immigrants and the CPB employees at the border\" when the expulsions policy was being discussed. \"I determined it was in the public health interest, at that time, to issue the order and it was a decision I made as CDC Director,\" Redfield added. \"CDC continues to evaluate the situation on the border and our future decisions will also be led by the science and data at the border locations.\"\\n\\nA White House spokesman said the policy has \"saved countless American lives by protecting border states, including Texas and Arizona, from having their hospitals overwhelmed and border patrol agents from infection.\" Customs and Border Protection (CBP) also defended it.\\n\\n\"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention determined that the introduction and spread of COVID-19 in CBP stations and temporary holding facilities presents a danger to illegal border crossers, our frontline agents and officers, doctors and nurses, and the American public,\" the agency said in a statement to CBS News. \"It would take just a small number of individuals with COVID-19 to infect a large number of detainees and CBP personnel and potentially overwhelm local healthcare systems along the border.\"\\n\\nAsked during an interview with CBS News in September why U.S. immigration officials couldn\\'t exclude unaccompanied children from the expulsions policy, Cuccinelli said, \"You don\\'t gain the benefit of a public health order by filling it with exceptions.\"\\n\\n\"The rules are clear. The circumstances are extraordinary due to COVID, even in addition to the fact that people are traveling illegally,\" Cuccinelli said. \"I don\\'t know why anyone would expect anything other than quick removal from this country when they cross knowingly, illegally, no matter what their age.\"\\n\\n\"Patently unlawful\"\\n\\nChildren who set foot on U.S. soil without authorization have long been afforded additional legal protections.\\n\\nIn 2008, President George W. Bush signed the bipartisan Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act, which requires all government agencies to quickly transfer non-Mexican unaccompanied migrant children to the Office of Refugee Resettlement and its network of shelters. Under that law, Mexican children can be transferred to Mexican authorities after being screened to ensure they are not victims of trafficking or persecution.\\n\\nIn this Feb. 8, 2019 file photo, Salvadoran teen migrant Xiomara Henriquez Ayala peers over to the U.S. border fence from Tijuana, Mexico, looking for a way to help her companions cross undetected. Emilio Espejel / AP\\n\\nWhile in the custody of the refugee agency, which is a division of HHS, children are connected with lawyers and in certain cases, with child advocates. Unlike adults, they are protected from expedited deportations and can have their asylum requests adjudicated by officers trained to hear humanitarian protection claims, rather than before an immigration judge in an adversarial courtroom setting.\\n\\nIn addition to asylum, which is a humanitarian protection against persecution, migrant children can also be eligible to legalize their status in the U.S. through visas for neglected, abused or abandoned minors.\\n\\nWhile migrant children face deportation proceedings, the government is mandated to continuously pursue their release from custody by placing them with sponsors, who are typically family members residing in the U.S. These protections are established in U.S. law and the landmark Flores court settlement.\\n\\nThe Trump administration has denounced this patchwork of legal safeguards, arguing the protections encourage children from poor and often violence-plagued areas of Central America to journey north with the help of smugglers. Through different policies, the administration has sought to dismantle it.\\n\\nBut officials had never suspended these protections — until now. Citing the pandemic, the Trump administration has argued that migrant children are not entitled to these safeguards, and that the laws that created them are effectively inoperative as long as the CDC\\'s orders remain in place.\\n\\nThe administration has even stopped using the legal term \"unaccompanied alien children\" for underage migrants apprehended by border authorities without their parents and placed in expulsion proceedings. Officials have been calling them \"single minors,\" a change designed to reduce \"litigation liability risk,\" according to the CBP documents obtained by Human Rights First.\\n\\nTwo federal judges have questioned the legality of the expulsion policy, saying the government should be harmonizing public health laws with the legal safeguards Congress created for migrant children.\\n\\n\"The Trump administration\\'s use of the public health laws to summarily expel children without hearings is patently unlawful, as the two judges who have looked at the issue have concluded,\" Lee Gelernt, the American Civil Liberties Union attorney challenging the expulsions edict in court, told CBS News.\\n\\nCiting the CDC order, U.S. authorities have pushed 6,500 unaccompanied children back into Mexico. Hundreds of unaccompanied children and families were also held in border hotels by U.S. officials seeking to expel them via deportation flights until a federal judge banned the practice in September, citing in part the limited access to lawyers.\\n\\nIn recent weeks, border authorities have allowed more unaccompanied children to stay in the U.S. The Office of Refugee Resettlement took in 1,218 migrant minors in September, compared to the 39 it received in May. Its in-custody population has increased to nearly 2,000, after plummeting to 800 in the summer.\\n\\nAttorneys believe the increased referrals to the U.S. refugee agency stem from their efforts to stop the expulsions of the children they are able to locate, as well as the court-mandated ban on hotel detention, which hinders DHS\\' ability to house minors waiting to be placed on deportation flights.\\n\\nThe U.S., however, continues to expel unaccompanied children. In October, Guatemala, the largest source of non-Mexican migration to the U.S. southern border, reported receiving 407 unaccompanied and underage deportees, compared to 230 in September and 254 in August. And apprehensions of unaccompanied minors at the U.S.-Mexico border have increased steadily since the spring, reaching nearly 4,000 in September.\\n\\nAdvocates fear the U.S. government will continue citing public health laws to expel them.\\n\\n\"The policies that the administration has adopted, which are supposedly meant to address COVID-19, are based on totally spurious justifications,\" Kennji Kizuka, a senior researcher at Human Rights First, told CBS News. \"They have nothing to do with protecting public health and everything to do with blocking asylum-seekers and unaccompanied children from getting the protections that Congress created for them.\"\\n\\n\"We have no safety here\"\\n\\nAfter being turned back by U.S. border officials, Noeli, Valeria and Josue, the expelled Salvadoran siblings, were shuffled around Mexico by immigration authorities there, ultimately ending up in a government holding facility in the southern state of Veracruz.\\n\\nEvelin, their mother in Maryland, said she frantically made all the calls she could and eventually reached a Salvadoran consular official in Veracruz who helped facilitate the release of her children. She had her daughters go back to the U.S. border, saying they were not going to be safe in El Salvador, where they don\\'t have immediate family members to care for them. Evelin said her adult son, Josue, did not cross with them out of fear that it would lead to the siblings being expelled to Mexico again.\\n\\nIn a 2 a.m. phone call, Evelin said U.S. officials told her that her daughters were going to be expelled yet again — this time to El Salvador. But with the help of the Young Center for Immigrant Children\\'s Rights and other U.S.-based advocates, the girls were instead transferred to the U.S. refugee agency. They spent a month in two Texas shelters before being released to Evelin on September 24.\\n\\n\"I was very emotional to see them again,\" Evelin told CBS News in Spanish. \"That has been my fight, to see them again and to make sure nothing happened to them in El Salvador. I\\'m happy to have them here. They suffered a lot. How did they send them like that to Mexico? They suffered a lot there, during the trip, facing hunger.\"\\n\\nDespite their experiences in Mexico, Evelin\\'s girls are some of the lucky few. They are the migrant children found by an \"underground railroad\" network of immigration lawyers, human rights activists and child advocates who support humanitarian-centered border policies.\\n\\n\"Migrant children facing expulsion stand no chance of being allowed to stay in the U.S. without legal representation,\" Taylor Levy, an immigration attorney in El Paso, told CBS News. \"I worked on the case of a teenage boy fleeing death threats following the murder of his live-in uncle; he was expelled mere hours before we reached out to the government after becoming aware of his case, without ever having the chance to seek asylum.\"\\n\\nGabriela, the 13-year-old girl expelled to El Salvador, is hiding from gangs, according to lawyers with the Texas Civil Rights Project who are in communication with her New York-based mother. The Texas non-profit filed a lawsuit in federal court in June to try to secure Gabriela\\'s return to the U.S. but the case has stalled.\\n\\nGustavo, 12, poses for a photo with his father, Juan. The 12-year-old boy was expelled from the U.S. southern border in August.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Gustavo, the 12-year-old disabled boy, is back in Petén, one of the most poverty-stricken parts of Guatemala where local authorities are often unable or unwilling to stop violent crime.\\n\\nGustavo\\'s parents were never notified by U.S. officials of their son\\'s expulsion. They said they located him through a Facebook post and help from the Los Angeles-based Immigrant Defenders Law Center. \"He didn\\'t deserve this,\" Juan, Gustavo\\'s father, told CBS News in Spanish.\\n\\nJuan, a farmer, said he does not know how he will escape the vicious cycle of poverty that traps many poor Guatemalans. Now that Gustavo is back, Juan said he also fears for his son\\'s safety, citing recent roadside killings of two family members.\\n\\n\"We have no safety here. The authorities don\\'t do anything in our country,\" Juan said. \"They kill over anything here. That\\'s why we look for a safer country.\"\\n\\nHundreds of miles away, Elida cried when recounting her decision to let Gustavo cross the U.S. border while she remained in Ciudad Juárez, where she said he was almost kidnapped. She is waiting for her U.S. asylum hearing, which has been postponed indefinitely due to the pandemic.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know what I\\'m going to do,\" Elida said while sobbing. \"I don\\'t want to be here without my son.\"',\n",

Stephane Mahe | Reuters\\n\\nPeople are tired in France where President Emanuel Macron imposed the country\\'s second nationwide lockdown beginning Friday to combat a resurgence of the coronavirus outbreak in Europe, says Parisian videographer Joseph Savage. \"There was a kind of united front the last time around – people were excited to do this together,\" Savage, 34, told CNBC in an interview. \"We know that we have to do it again, but the general consensus is that people are fed up and a bit sad to go through it again and not knowing when it\\'s going to end.\" Retired 70-year-old dental nurse Kathleen Williams, who lives in Lancashire, England, where Prime Minister Boris Johnson just instituted a new four-week stay-at-home order across that starts Thursday, agrees. The new lockdown order allows people to leave their homes only for essential purposes, like going to school, the doctor and grocery stores. Williams says the cold weather makes it more isolating this time around. \"People are getting a bit worn down with it all and seem to breaking the rules a bit more,\" she said in an interview.

Jason Alden | Bloomberg | Getty Images\\n\\nAs the United States teeters on the edge of what some say is the start of a dark winter with roughly 90,000 new Covid-19 cases per day, Europe is already seeing an \"astronomical\" number of new cases and deaths, prompting governments to roll out strict lockdown measures to slow the spread. Like the U.S., pandemic fatigue has set in across Europe where residents say pubs and bars in the U.K. and France have been packed before the lockdowns took effect. It\\'s led to a resurgence in the virus across Europe and America where people miss human contact and have grown weary of working in isolation for months on end. The worsening outbreak in Europe is starting to strain hospital systems there, which epidemiologists worry will happen in the U.S. in the coming weeks. Over the past seven days, France reported an average of more than 31,000 new cases a day on Tuesday following a record of 53,464 average new cases on Sunday, according to a CNBC analysis of data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. The United Kingdom has averaged more than 22,347 new cases per day over the previous week, Hopkins data shows. Italy reported a record 27,864 average new cases on Tuesday, up 58% from the previous week, according to the data. Germany reported a seven-day average of 17,048 new cases Monday, a new record and up by a whopping 63% compared with a week ago, according to Hopkins data. The steep rise led Chancellor Angela Merkel to announce a new \"partial lockdown\" last week to avoid overwhelming hospitals. Bars, theaters and clubs will be closed with restaurants limited to carryout and delivery service.\\n\\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel takes off her face mask as she gives a press conference on the actual situation amid the novel coronavirus / COVID-19 pandemic, following a meeting with her so-called Corona-Cabinet, on November 2, 2020 in Berlin. Kay Nietfeld | AFP | Getty Images\\n\\nLike in the U.S., there have been demonstrations across Germany, protesting the restrictions, said Dr. Bill Schaffner, an epidemiologist at Vanderbilt University whose son lives in Berlin. \"There is fatigue and I actually characterize it as annoyance at the fact that this virus, which they cannot see, has intruded on their lives and upset us, economically, socially, culturally in every way,\" he said. \"They\\'re annoyed at the virus. They want it to just go away.\" Lara-Maria Kullack-Ublick, a 33-year-old account manager in Berlin, said she only complies with the rules and restrictions in public \"out of respect and consideration for other people.\" \"Personally, I am not very afraid of Corona and therefore do not follow the rules for myself,\" she said. \"In my private life I am therefore not that strict and also meet more people than allowed and do not keep the desired safety distance from these people, unless they want to.\" David Cain, a senior management consultant for the U.K.\\'s National Health Service, said people strictly followed the rules there at the beginning of the outbreak, but that\\'s changed. Cain said some people have been reluctant to cooperate with contact tracers because they don\\'t want to be asked to remain home and potentially lose income. He added that not as many people are volunteering now to deliver groceries and other supplies to more at-risk individuals. \"I don\\'t think people are adhering to lockdown like they were at the start,\" he said. \"They\\'re not staying in. I think people are now a little bit: this has gone on too long. That\\'s not our view, but people are weary with it; they\\'re not sure.\"\\n\\nIt\\'s a similar story in the U.S. where cases have started to surge again over the past month. If Americans can\\'t follow mask and social distancing rules, U.S. policymakers may need to consider more statewide and local lockdowns like those seen in Europe, Dr. Syra Madad, senior director of the systemwide special pathogens program at New York City Health + Hospitals, said \"If cases continue to rise, that means the virus is winning and then we\\'re going to have to go into these massive shelter-in-place situations that you\\'re seeing across Europe,\" she said. \"Whether you\\'re in the United States or whether you\\'re in Europe, either you decide what to do or the virus is going to decide for you.\" Former Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said the U.S. outbreak is about three weeks behind Europe, where cases are \"astronomical.\" \"If we get to the levels of some of the European countries like France and Italy, Spain, the U.K. are experiencing, it\\'s going to really press our health care system across the country,\" he told CNBC last week. Dominique Costagliola, an epidemiologist at the Inserm research institute in Paris, said there are a number of parallels between the outbreak in France and the one in the U.S. She said the outbreaks in both countries are distinct from what was seen this spring in that the virus is now widely circulating in rural communities. \"Initially the rise was mainly seen in the cities and suburbs of the cities, but now it\\'s everywhere,\" Costagliola said in a phone interview. \"This week, you can see that the situation is worsening everywhere, including outside the cities.\" Both the U.S. and France have drastically ramped up testing compared with this spring, Inserm\\'s Costagliola added. However, she said, the contact tracing infrastructure around testing has been largely forgotten in both the U.S. and France, which has hampered the responses in both countries. \"It\\'s bizarre that after what happened in March, most of the European countries don\\'t realize that the sooner you do take the measures, the better,\" she said. \"When you\\'ve got the small fire, it\\'s easier to care for it than when you have just fire everywhere in the country at a very high level. We need to act now, act early.\"\\n\\nA woman walks past a poster featuring a nurse wearing a protective mask and thanking all the professions that have supported the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic on a street in Rennes, western France on November 02, 2020, as France is under a new general lockdown to curb the spread of the Covid-19 novel coronavirus. Damien Meyer | AFP | Getty Images\\n\\nFrance last week entered a lockdown period where all residents must stay inside, except to get groceries and conduct other essential business, or risk fines and criminal prosecution. Unlike under the previous lockdown in March, schools will stay open. Bars in Paris were \"packed\" last week with people \"having one last night before locking down again,\" said Savage, the videographer in Paris. \"This is enough – it worked last time. I\\'m not sure if people are going to respect it as much as last time because people are tired, it\\'s autumn. The end of the year. People are a bit disillusioned,\" he said. \"The youth are less fearful than they were first time around.\" Liz Warren, a 30-year-old freelancer in Paris, said she\\'s upset the French government didn\\'t crack down sooner. She said she\\'s been following the rules. She added that \"if you\\'re not wearing a mask outside you will get stares.\" \"I feel slightly enraged about that announcement only because the French government acted way too late on the whole situation — when I think back to August and September everything was still extremely lax and no one was really wearing masks on the streets, everyone was piling into the terraces outside,\" she said. Hannah Weiler, a 25-year-old medical student in Cologne, Germany, said she follows the rules about 95% of the time. But, she said, she\\'s observed others not wearing a mask in public and failing to social distance. \"People just need to be disciplined more, really, and show some more solidarity,\" she said. The new restrictions, she added, \"just forces people to meet up at home privately again, which is way worse because that\\'s where you have no hygiene barriers, you have no walls, it\\'s not regulated.\" CNBC\\'s Elliot Smith, Lucy Handley in London, Natasha Turak in Dubai and Nate Rattner and Noah Higgins-Dunn in New York contributed to this article.',\n",

Drivers also waited in the parking lot of a shopping mall in West El Paso, where the county set up a curbside polling place.\\n\\nAlong with \"I voted\" stickers emblazoned with \"El Paso Strong\" -- the slogan that became a rallying cry for the community after a gunman opened fire at a busy Walmart store last year, killing 23 people -- voters also received sanitizing wipes, a Q-tip and a finger cot to touch the voting machines.\\n\\nBrenda Negrete, a generalist for the El Paso County Elections Department, said El Pasoans were \"excited\" that more than 10,000 people cast their ballots in the first three hours of voting on Election Day.\\n\\n\"It\\'s not stopping them,\" Negrete said. \"We saw it the first day of early voting and we are seeing it now.\"\\n\\nSinger Khalid encouraged El Pasoans to vote and take \"extra safety precautions because COVID is rising at an exponential rate!\" The artist, who moved to El Paso during his senior year of high school, said he voted in El Paso last week on the last day of early voting.\\n\\nOutside the Pavo Real Recreation Center, which served as a polling station in El Paso\\'s Lower Valley area, US Rep. Veronica Escobar spoke to voters in person and virtually.\\n\\n\"Please mask up, go vote and then go back home,\" Escobar, who is running for reelection in the 16th Congressional District, said on Instagram.\\n\\nLast week, more than 10,000 people in El Paso tested positive for Covid-19.\\n\\nAs of Tuesday morning, El Paso County, which sits on the southern border with Mexico, had reported 1,085 new positive Covid-19 tests and four new deaths, bringing the total death toll to 609, according to the City/County of El Paso Covid-19 website . Officials said 998 people were hospitalized on Tuesday.\\n\\nVoters line up as the polling station opened at Fire Station No. 3 in El Paso, Texas.\\n\\nState officials are battling shutdown ordered by the county\\n\\nThe city is currently under a two-week shutdown of nonessential services and a curfew related to coronavirus, but officials have said voting will not be affected.\\n\\nLast week, El Paso County Judge Ricardo Samaniego, a Democrat, went against directives by the Republican governor and issued a two-week shutdown of nonessential services, such as tattoo parlors, hair and nail salons and gyms. Restaurants in the county will be limited to delivery or curbside service.\\n\\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton filed a motion for a temporary injunction on Tuesday to stop the \"unlawful lockdown order.\"\\n\\n\"I am optimistic that the district court will recognize the unlawfulness of this action and quickly stop these orders from further oppressing the El Paso community.\"\\n\\n\"Judge Samaniego has no authority to flout Gov. Abbott\\'s executive orders by shutting down businesses in El Paso County,\" Paxton said in a statement.\\n\\nTexas was one of the first states in the country to begin a phased-in approach of reopening back in May. As the summer surge of cases rippled across Texas and the nation, Gov. Gregg Abbott took steps like closing down bars and issuing a mask mandate, but he largely maintains authority when it comes to shutdowns.\\n\\nA hearing on the motion has been scheduled for Wednesday.',\n",

       "  'text': '(CNN) If you think a negative test result means you don\\'t have coronavirus, you could be wrong.\\n\\nIt can take days before a new infection shows up on a Covid-19 test.\\n\\n\"We know that the incubation period for Covid-19 is up to 14 days. And before that, you can be testing negative, and have no symptoms,\" emergency medicine physician Dr. Leana Wen told CNN. \"But you could actually be harboring the virus and be able to transmit it to others.\"\\n\\nSo if you want to get tested as a precaution before seeing friends or family, here\\'s what you need to know:\\n\\nIf I got infected yesterday, would a test today pick that up?\\n\\nProbably not. A study in the medical journal Annals of Internal Medicine examined false-negative test results of people who actually had Covid-19\\n\\nThe study estimated that during four days of infection before symptoms typically started, the probability of getting an incorrect/negative test result on Day 1 was 100%\\n\\nOn the day people started showing symptoms, the average false-negative rate had dropped to 38%, according to the study. Three days after symptoms started, the false-negative rate dropped to 20%.\\n\\n\"The virus just takes time to replicate in the body to detectable levels,\" said Justin Lessler, a senior author of the study and associate professor of epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.\\n\\n\"You can get infected by just a few viral particles, but these will not be detectable until they have time to replicate to adequate levels to be detected,\" he told CNN by email.\\n\\nSo how many days should a person wait after possible exposure to get tested?\\n\\n\"There is no hard and fast rule, but the evidence suggests getting a test before the third day after exposure is not of much use,\" Lessler said.\\n\\nCould I be contagious while testing negative?\\n\\nAbsolutely. \"People sort of feel like if you test (negative), you\\'re out of the woods. And you\\'re kind of not,\" said Dr. Rochelle Walensky, chief of the infectious diseases division at Massachusetts General Hospital.\\n\\nFor people who get sick with Covid-19, symptoms can take up to two weeks to appear, but the average time is about five days, Walensky said.\\n\\n\"It\\'s generally thought that you\\'re most infectious the two days before that day and the two days after that,\" she said.\\n\\nOne reason why this virus spreads so easily is because people can be infectious without any symptoms. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 40% of infections are asymptomatic, and 50% of transmissions happen before symptoms begin.\\n\\n\"It\\'s been among the biggest Achilles\\' heels of this. And it\\'s been among the biggest challenges and the unexpected things because (with) its cousins, this is not true,\" Walensky said.\\n\\n\"The reason we were able to control the SARS outbreak so quickly -- although there were obviously a lot of deaths there -- but it didn\\'t turn into a pandemic is because people weren\\'t shedding (the virus) until they got symptoms.\"\\n\\nDo different kinds of Covid-19 tests matter?\\n\\nWhen it comes to diagnostic tests -- those that detect whether you have an active coronavirus infection -- there are two main types:\\n\\nMolecular tests, such as PCR tests, look for the virus\\' genetic material. Most of these tests are performed with nasal swabs or throat swabs, though some can be done using saliva, the , such as PCR tests, look for the virus\\' genetic material. Most of these tests are performed with nasal swabs or throat swabs, though some can be done using saliva, the US Food and Drug Administration says.\\n\\n\"This test is typically highly accurate and usually does not need to be repeated,\" the FDA says.\\n\\nBut the downside to molecular testing is that results can take a while -- anywhere from the same day to one week after testing.\\n\\n\"For people who show symptoms, so far the studies show the accuracy of the molecular test to find a positive case increases with each day after the exposure,\" said Pia MacDonald, infectious disease epidemiologist at the nonprofit research institute RTI International.\\n\\nBut for infected people who don\\'t get symptoms, the accuracy rates are less clear, she said. \"Molecular test performance studies on asymptomatic people are very limited.\"\\n\\nAntigen tests don\\'t look for the virus\\' genetic material, like molecular tests do. Instead, they look for specific proteins on the surface of the virus.\\n\\nThe good news is you can get antigen test results in less than an hour. The bad news is you\\'re more likely to get a false negative with a rapid antigen test.\\n\\n\"Positive results are usually highly accurate but negative results may need to be confirmed with a molecular test,\" the FDA says.\\n\\n\"Antigen tests are more likely to miss an active coronavirus infection compared to molecular tests.\"\\n\\nThis could help explain some of the recent spread of Covid-19 linked to the White House.\\n\\nRegardless of which type of diagnostic test you use, you\\'re generally more likely to get a false negative than a false positive.\\n\\n\"If a molecular test is positive, it\\'s an accurate reflection of a person being infected,\" MacDonald said. \"If it\\'s negative, it\\'s less reliable that the person is indeed negative. The same is true of the antigen tests.\"\\n\\nCan I test myself at home?\\n\\nUsers take their own nasal swab samples and mail them to a lab, which will send results digitally within 24 to 48 hours of receiving the samples. Yes. There are some at-home testing kits available, such at the Everlywell Covid-19 molecular test Users take their own nasal swab samples and mail them to a lab, which will send results digitally within 24 to 48 hours of receiving the samples.\\n\\nBut taking any kind of Covid-19 test too early might miss an infection, said Dr. Frank Ong, chief medical and scientific officer at Everlywell.\\n\\n\"As testing capacity has continued to increase, more and more asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic individuals have undergone testing, most of whom likely have lower viral loads in their clinical samples,\" he said.\\n\\n\"My best advice is to treat yourself as if you are likely infected after suspected exposure. Quarantine, wear a mask to cover both nose and mouth, and practice good hygiene practices. If you want to take extra precautions or you believe you may have been exposed, get tested for the virus using an FDA-authorized test for Covid-19.\"\\n\\nSo what should I do if I want to see friends or relatives?\\n\\nIf you insist on seeing loved ones for Thanksgiving, self-quarantining for 14 days beforehand is probably your safest bet, Walensky said.\\n\\n\"A 14-day quarantine -- with a real quarantine -- if you do that properly, you don\\'t need a test,\" she said. \"That\\'s probably the cleanest way to do it.\"\\n\\nTo be clear: Quarantining means staying home. It does not mean you can run errands.\\n\\n\"\\'Grocery store\\' and \\'quarantine\\' don\\'t belong in the same sentence,\" Walensky said.\\n\\nAdding testing to your list of precautions \"is a helpful thing, but only if it\\'s done properly,\" she said. \"And if you don\\'t know exactly when or how to use it, then you very well could be setting yourself up for a false sense of security.\"\\n\\nLessler agreed that quarantining is best, and testing must be done intelligently.\\n\\n\"If you are visiting an elderly family member and have a reasonable risk of having been exposed, there is no substitute for 14 days of quarantine,\" Lessler said.\\n\\n\"At the very least I would wait 10 days and have a negative test. If you are visiting a younger, healthy family member and have little chance of being exposed before or during travel, then 5 or 7 days (of quarantine) plus a negative test is probably plenty of risk reduction, though no guarantee of safety. Either way, you should definitely remain in quarantine while awaiting test results and make sure everyone you are getting together with is on the same page about the plan for controlling infection risk.\"\\n\\nThere have already been cases of coronavirus spread within families just days after a person tested negative, said Dr. Michael St. Louis, a member of the CDC\\'s Community Guidance Team.\\n\\nHe said everyone must remember to treat family from different households the same way you would treat unrelated friends or work colleagues during this pandemic.\\n\\nOf course, the best way to help ensure the safety of all your loved ones is to celebrate the holidays remotely.\\n\\n\"I have three kids. ... And my parents are not going to be joining us this year,\" Walensky said.\\n\\n\"It\\'s just awful. But what I really hold out for is that my parents are pretty healthy, and I would never forgive myself if I put them in harm\\'s way. And I\\'m just looking forward to a 2021 when we can be together.\"\\n\\nThe CDC suggests celebrating with loved ones virtually online. You can also make traditional Thanksgiving dishes and deliver them \" in a way that doesn\\'t involve contact \" to relatives, neighbors or those who might be feeling lonely.\\n\\nWalensky said the small sacrifices made this Thanksgiving will help ensure everyone will be healthy enough to sit at the table next year.\\n\\n\"At least they\\'ll be there next year, whereas irresponsible behavior now might mean they won\\'t be here later,\" she said.\\n\\n\"Let\\'s do this so that we can have a much better shot of being around the table together, healthy, in 2021.\"',\n",

       "  'text': 'Salvadoran sisters Noeli, 15, and Valeria, 12, hoped to start an immigration case and reunite with their mother in Maryland after five years apart when they crossed the U.S.-Mexico border in August with their brother, Josue, 23. But U.S. border agents quickly turned them back to Mexico.\\n\\nGrabriela, 13, hoped to apply for asylum when she reached the Texas border in April, just as her mother had done years earlier when she fled gangs in El Salvador. But after being apprehended by U.S. officials, the girl was detained in a hotel and then placed on a deportation flight.\\n\\nAfter waiting months in Mexico\\'s violence-plagued Ciudad Juárez for her U.S. court hearing, Elida allowed her 12-year-old son Gustavo to present himself to U.S. border officials, thinking he would be allowed to reunite with his grandfather in South Carolina. Instead, Gustavo, a largely non-verbal boy with physical and learning disabilities, was expelled to Guatemala alone.\\n\\nGet Breaking News Delivered to Your Inbox\\n\\nPrior to mid-March, these migrant children would have been housed in shelters and allowed to seek asylum or other forms of U.S. sanctuary with the help of lawyers. But their rapid expulsions from the U.S. are part of the Trump administration\\'s unprecedented efforts to use the COVID-19 pandemic as justification to sidestep legal protections for minors who arrive at America\\'s borders without documents.\\n\\nBy designating them public health threats who could spread the virus, the Trump administration has expelled at least 8,800 unaccompanied migrant children, some as young as 10, without a court hearing or asylum screening, circumventing safeguards Congress created to shield them from trafficking, exploitation and persecution.\\n\\nIn all, more than 204,000 of these expulsions have been carried out across the U.S.-Mexico border since March, according to government data.\\n\\nPresident Trump\\'s top immigration enforcement officials have portrayed the emergency policy as strictly based on public health and greenlighted by orders from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\\n\\nHowever, the White House and senior advisor Stephen Miller aggressively pressured the CDC to implement the order, bypassing objections from experts at the agency who believed there was no public health basis to invoke a 1940s law to shutter U.S. borders to migrants, including asylum-seekers and children, three former Trump administration officials familiar with the discussions told CBS News. The officials were granted anonymity in order to speak frankly about internal deliberations.\\n\\n\"We were forced to do it,\" one former official who worked on public health told CBS News. \"We exhausted all of the options. We delayed. We slow-rolled. We flat out said there\\'s not a public health justification. We said no. And then we were told, \\'Do it.\\' So, at the end of the day, your options are to resign in protest or sign it. And if you resign in protest, the next person is just going to do it anyways.\"\\n\\nA border patrol agent walks along a border wall separating Tijuana, Mexico, from San Diego, Wednesday, March 18, 2020, in San Diego. Gregory Bull / AP\\n\\nAccording to two of the former officials, career experts at the CDC\\'s Division of Global Migration and Quarantine — which would have jurisdiction over border measures to contain the virus — refused to be involved in the expulsions order. Instead, these former officials said, the order was drafted by Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) lawyer Brian Stimson, a political appointee. An HHS spokesperson said \"career and political attorneys\" who serve as lawyers for the CDC were involved because the order was a \"public health and legal matter.\"\\n\\nAfter mounting White House pressure, including a call from Vice President Mike Pence, CDC Director Robert Redfield signed the directive, which took effect on March 20. Katie Miller, a spokeswoman for Pence who is married to Miller, denied that the vice president \"directed the CDC on this issue.\"\\n\\n\"It was one of many tough choices that we were forced to make, and ultimately the White House and their preference prevailed,\" a second former public health official told CBS News. \"Public health authority had never been used in this way. A lot of folks, myself included, felt that this was a misappropriation of that authority.\"\\n\\nCDC officials initially were able to \"pare down\" the order so that it would have to be reauthorized every 30 days. In May, after two renewals, the order was extended indefinitely. A subsequent order issued last month will be in place until the CDC director determines \"the danger of further introduction of COVID-19 into the United States has ceased to be a serious danger.\"\\n\\n\"I guarantee you, under this administration, it will never happen,\" one of the former public health officials said. \"It will take a new administration, a new director to come in and say, \\'This is BS, I\\'m pulling it.\\'\"\\n\\nFor the first time, Joe Biden\\'s campaign on Sunday said the former vice president would order a review of the policy if elected. \"A Biden Administration would direct the CDC and DHS to review this policy and make the appropriate changes to ensure that people have the ability to submit their asylum claims while ensuring that we are taking the appropriate COVID-19 safety precautions, as guided by the science and public health experts,\" campaign spokesperson Pili Tobar told CBS News.\\n\\nThe Associated Press and The Wall Street Journal have also reported on the White House\\'s campaign to overrule CDC officials who opposed the border expulsions order.\\n\\nOn March 27, seven days after the CDC order took effect, Chad Mizelle, the top lawyer at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), sent a memo to Ken Cuccinelli, the second-in-command at the department, proposing to further restrict asylum eligibility based on the pandemic, according to documents obtained by the group Human Rights First under the Freedom of Information Act.\\n\\nIn a statement provided by the White House, Redfield said \"data pointed to a public health risk from COVID-19 to the illegal immigrants and the CPB employees at the border\" when the expulsions policy was being discussed. \"I determined it was in the public health interest, at that time, to issue the order and it was a decision I made as CDC Director,\" Redfield added. \"CDC continues to evaluate the situation on the border and our future decisions will also be led by the science and data at the border locations.\"\\n\\nA White House spokesman said the policy has \"saved countless American lives by protecting border states, including Texas and Arizona, from having their hospitals overwhelmed and border patrol agents from infection.\" Customs and Border Protection (CBP) also defended it.\\n\\n\"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention determined that the introduction and spread of COVID-19 in CBP stations and temporary holding facilities presents a danger to illegal border crossers, our frontline agents and officers, doctors and nurses, and the American public,\" the agency said in a statement to CBS News. \"It would take just a small number of individuals with COVID-19 to infect a large number of detainees and CBP personnel and potentially overwhelm local healthcare systems along the border.\"\\n\\nAsked during an interview with CBS News in September why U.S. immigration officials couldn\\'t exclude unaccompanied children from the expulsions policy, Cuccinelli said, \"You don\\'t gain the benefit of a public health order by filling it with exceptions.\"\\n\\n\"The rules are clear. The circumstances are extraordinary due to COVID, even in addition to the fact that people are traveling illegally,\" Cuccinelli said. \"I don\\'t know why anyone would expect anything other than quick removal from this country when they cross knowingly, illegally, no matter what their age.\"\\n\\n\"Patently unlawful\"\\n\\nChildren who set foot on U.S. soil without authorization have long been afforded additional legal protections.\\n\\nIn 2008, President George W. Bush signed the bipartisan Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act, which requires all government agencies to quickly transfer non-Mexican unaccompanied migrant children to the Office of Refugee Resettlement and its network of shelters. Under that law, Mexican children can be transferred to Mexican authorities after being screened to ensure they are not victims of trafficking or persecution.\\n\\nIn this Feb. 8, 2019 file photo, Salvadoran teen migrant Xiomara Henriquez Ayala peers over to the U.S. border fence from Tijuana, Mexico, looking for a way to help her companions cross undetected. Emilio Espejel / AP\\n\\nWhile in the custody of the refugee agency, which is a division of HHS, children are connected with lawyers and in certain cases, with child advocates. Unlike adults, they are protected from expedited deportations and can have their asylum requests adjudicated by officers trained to hear humanitarian protection claims, rather than before an immigration judge in an adversarial courtroom setting.\\n\\nIn addition to asylum, which is a humanitarian protection against persecution, migrant children can also be eligible to legalize their status in the U.S. through visas for neglected, abused or abandoned minors.\\n\\nWhile migrant children face deportation proceedings, the government is mandated to continuously pursue their release from custody by placing them with sponsors, who are typically family members residing in the U.S. These protections are established in U.S. law and the landmark Flores court settlement.\\n\\nThe Trump administration has denounced this patchwork of legal safeguards, arguing the protections encourage children from poor and often violence-plagued areas of Central America to journey north with the help of smugglers. Through different policies, the administration has sought to dismantle it.\\n\\nBut officials had never suspended these protections — until now. Citing the pandemic, the Trump administration has argued that migrant children are not entitled to these safeguards, and that the laws that created them are effectively inoperative as long as the CDC\\'s orders remain in place.\\n\\nThe administration has even stopped using the legal term \"unaccompanied alien children\" for underage migrants apprehended by border authorities without their parents and placed in expulsion proceedings. Officials have been calling them \"single minors,\" a change designed to reduce \"litigation liability risk,\" according to the CBP documents obtained by Human Rights First.\\n\\nTwo federal judges have questioned the legality of the expulsion policy, saying the government should be harmonizing public health laws with the legal safeguards Congress created for migrant children.\\n\\n\"The Trump administration\\'s use of the public health laws to summarily expel children without hearings is patently unlawful, as the two judges who have looked at the issue have concluded,\" Lee Gelernt, the American Civil Liberties Union attorney challenging the expulsions edict in court, told CBS News.\\n\\nCiting the CDC order, U.S. authorities have pushed 6,500 unaccompanied children back into Mexico. Hundreds of unaccompanied children and families were also held in border hotels by U.S. officials seeking to expel them via deportation flights until a federal judge banned the practice in September, citing in part the limited access to lawyers.\\n\\nIn recent weeks, border authorities have allowed more unaccompanied children to stay in the U.S. The Office of Refugee Resettlement took in 1,218 migrant minors in September, compared to the 39 it received in May. Its in-custody population has increased to nearly 2,000, after plummeting to 800 in the summer.\\n\\nAttorneys believe the increased referrals to the U.S. refugee agency stem from their efforts to stop the expulsions of the children they are able to locate, as well as the court-mandated ban on hotel detention, which hinders DHS\\' ability to house minors waiting to be placed on deportation flights.\\n\\nThe U.S., however, continues to expel unaccompanied children. In October, Guatemala, the largest source of non-Mexican migration to the U.S. southern border, reported receiving 407 unaccompanied and underage deportees, compared to 230 in September and 254 in August. And apprehensions of unaccompanied minors at the U.S.-Mexico border have increased steadily since the spring, reaching nearly 4,000 in September.\\n\\nAdvocates fear the U.S. government will continue citing public health laws to expel them.\\n\\n\"The policies that the administration has adopted, which are supposedly meant to address COVID-19, are based on totally spurious justifications,\" Kennji Kizuka, a senior researcher at Human Rights First, told CBS News. \"They have nothing to do with protecting public health and everything to do with blocking asylum-seekers and unaccompanied children from getting the protections that Congress created for them.\"\\n\\n\"We have no safety here\"\\n\\nAfter being turned back by U.S. border officials, Noeli, Valeria and Josue, the expelled Salvadoran siblings, were shuffled around Mexico by immigration authorities there, ultimately ending up in a government holding facility in the southern state of Veracruz.\\n\\nEvelin, their mother in Maryland, said she frantically made all the calls she could and eventually reached a Salvadoran consular official in Veracruz who helped facilitate the release of her children. She had her daughters go back to the U.S. border, saying they were not going to be safe in El Salvador, where they don\\'t have immediate family members to care for them. Evelin said her adult son, Josue, did not cross with them out of fear that it would lead to the siblings being expelled to Mexico again.\\n\\nIn a 2 a.m. phone call, Evelin said U.S. officials told her that her daughters were going to be expelled yet again — this time to El Salvador. But with the help of the Young Center for Immigrant Children\\'s Rights and other U.S.-based advocates, the girls were instead transferred to the U.S. refugee agency. They spent a month in two Texas shelters before being released to Evelin on September 24.\\n\\n\"I was very emotional to see them again,\" Evelin told CBS News in Spanish. \"That has been my fight, to see them again and to make sure nothing happened to them in El Salvador. I\\'m happy to have them here. They suffered a lot. How did they send them like that to Mexico? They suffered a lot there, during the trip, facing hunger.\"\\n\\nDespite their experiences in Mexico, Evelin\\'s girls are some of the lucky few. They are the migrant children found by an \"underground railroad\" network of immigration lawyers, human rights activists and child advocates who support humanitarian-centered border policies.\\n\\n\"Migrant children facing expulsion stand no chance of being allowed to stay in the U.S. without legal representation,\" Taylor Levy, an immigration attorney in El Paso, told CBS News. \"I worked on the case of a teenage boy fleeing death threats following the murder of his live-in uncle; he was expelled mere hours before we reached out to the government after becoming aware of his case, without ever having the chance to seek asylum.\"\\n\\nGabriela, the 13-year-old girl expelled to El Salvador, is hiding from gangs, according to lawyers with the Texas Civil Rights Project who are in communication with her New York-based mother. The Texas non-profit filed a lawsuit in federal court in June to try to secure Gabriela\\'s return to the U.S. but the case has stalled.\\n\\nGustavo, 12, poses for a photo with his father, Juan. The 12-year-old boy was expelled from the U.S. southern border in August.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Gustavo, the 12-year-old disabled boy, is back in Petén, one of the most poverty-stricken parts of Guatemala where local authorities are often unable or unwilling to stop violent crime.\\n\\nGustavo\\'s parents were never notified by U.S. officials of their son\\'s expulsion. They said they located him through a Facebook post and help from the Los Angeles-based Immigrant Defenders Law Center. \"He didn\\'t deserve this,\" Juan, Gustavo\\'s father, told CBS News in Spanish.\\n\\nJuan, a farmer, said he does not know how he will escape the vicious cycle of poverty that traps many poor Guatemalans. Now that Gustavo is back, Juan said he also fears for his son\\'s safety, citing recent roadside killings of two family members.\\n\\n\"We have no safety here. The authorities don\\'t do anything in our country,\" Juan said. \"They kill over anything here. That\\'s why we look for a safer country.\"\\n\\nHundreds of miles away, Elida cried when recounting her decision to let Gustavo cross the U.S. border while she remained in Ciudad Juárez, where she said he was almost kidnapped. She is waiting for her U.S. asylum hearing, which has been postponed indefinitely due to the pandemic.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know what I\\'m going to do,\" Elida said while sobbing. \"I don\\'t want to be here without my son.\"',\n",

So last week, the state ordered residents to wear masks in any gathering of two or more people at places such as stores, offices and schools, the state\\'s health department said.\\n\\nLocal officials enact curfews\\n\\nSome cities and counties are now under nightly curfews, including Miami-Dade County, Florida; El Paso County, Texas; and Pueblo, Colorado, which have all seen rampant spikes in new Covid-19 infections.\\n\\n\"What we are facing in Pueblo is a public health disaster, which threatens lives and our economy,\" Mayor Nicholas Gradisar said Thursday in announcing a two-week curfew.\\n\\nMeanwhile, El Paso County, Texas, has implemented a two-week curfew, said Judge Ricardo Samaniego, the top government official in the county. Samaniego said all hospitals and intensive care units in the El Paso area had already hit 100% capacity.\\n\\nIn Florida, anyone in Miami-Dade County must wear a mask in public when social distancing is not possible or when there is no physical barrier present, according to an order from County Mayor Carlos Giménez. Miami-Dade said the mask mandate is good for business, too.\\n\\nRestaurants must collect diners\\' personal info\\n\\nIn Michigan, restaurant diners and bar patrons must provide their phone numbers for contact tracing in case they get exposed to someone with coronavirus, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services said.\\n\\nNew York state announced similar rules in September. At least one member of each party dining at a restaurant indoors must provide contact information in case a contact tracer needs to reach them, Gov. Andrew Cuomo\\'s office said.\\n\\nCapacity slashed at stores and places of worship\\n\\nSome states are also clamping down on crowd sizes, both indoors and outdoors.\\n\\nConnecticut, which had been one of the most successful states at handling the pandemic, will limit restaurants to 50% capacity, Gov. Ned Lamont said Monday.\\n\\nReligious ceremonies in Connecticut are limited to 50% capacity or 100 people, whichever is smaller. Indoor event spaces are limited to 25 people, outdoor event spaces to 50 people, and theaters to 100 people.\\n\\nIllinois is now under \"resurgence mitigations\" after test positivity rates soared in all regions of the state. As of Wednesday, all indoor restaurant and bar service is banned, and all meetings, gatherings or social events are limited to 25% capacity or a total of 25 guests, whichever is fewer.\\n\\nIn Colorado, health officials have backtracked on Denver\\'s reopening. Restaurants are now limited to 25% capacity indoors, or no more than 50 people total per room. Places of worship are capped at 25% capacity or 50 people, and retail stores are now limited to 25% capacity.\\n\\nRead more:',\n",

Larry Hogan warned of a major surge in coronavirus cases and urged residents Thursday to wear masks to prevent the virus’s spread.\\n\\nMaryland’s statewide mask mandate remains in full effect, the Republican governor said during a news conference. Under this order, all Marylanders over the age of 5 are required to wear face coverings in the public spaces of all businesses across the state.\\n\\n“It is the best way to keep you and your family members safe, keep people out of the hospital, save lives and to keep Maryland open for business,” Hogan said.\\n\\nHogan also said he didn’t believe new restrictions were needed on businesses, but he warned against complacency toward current rules now in place.\\n\\n“I think right now, enforcing the existing laws that people aren’t following is more important than adding new ones,” he said.\\n\\nWhile the governor said Maryland is in a much better position than in the spring and that the state is better prepared than most states, “the warning lights are starting to flash on the dashboard.”\\n\\nDr. David Marcozzi, the COVID-19 incident commander for the University of Maryland Medical System, said the state is “entering a period of high risk” in the next few months, because the virus spreads more easily when people gather indoors together.\\n\\n___\\n\\nMADISON, Wis. - Wisconsin’s chief health officer quit Thursday as COVID-19 continues to run rampant across the state, saying her job has been hard and she needs to pay more attention to herself and her family.\\n\\nState Health Officer and Department of Health Services Interim Division of Public Health Administrator Stephanie Smiley is the second state health officer to resign in the last six months.\\n\\nShe announced her resignation would be effective Nov. 11 in a letter to local health departments. She wrote that she has accepted a position outside state service so she can focus more on her own health and family.\\n\\nSmiley stepped into the health officer role after Gov. Tony Evers’ administration forced her predecessor, Jeanne Ayers, to resign in May.\\n\\nThe DHS reported an additional 5,922 confirmed cases Thursday, just 17 cases shy of the daily case record of 5,935 set Wednesday.\\n\\n— SALEM, Ore. - The Oregon Health Authority reported 805 new confirmed COVID-19 cases Thursday, breaking the state’s previous daily record of 600.\\n\\nOfficials described the increased spread of COVID-19 in the state as “unprecedented” and occurring “more rapidly” than they had hoped.\\n\\n“Let me be clear, we cannot allow this disease to continue to spread so rapidly in our communities. Lives are at stake,” Gov. Kate Brown said. “Oregonians have made tremendous sacrifices to help each other throughout this pandemic, which is why Oregon has done relatively better than many other states at containing COVID-19. We can’t let up now.”\\n\\nIn addition, health officials said the percentage of positive COVID-19 tests last week was 8.5%.\\n\\n___\\n\\nMINNEAPOLIS - Hospitals and healthcare systems across Minnesota are bracing for a wave of new patients as the state sees alarming growth in virus cases and hospitalizations are expected to follow.\\n\\nThe state’s health department reported 3,956 new confirmed coronavirus cases and 25 deaths on Thursday, breaking the single-day record for new cases for the third straight day. The state’s totals since the pandemic began now sit at 164,865 cases and 2,555 deaths.\\n\\nMinnesota health officials said Wednesday that more than 800 patients were hospitalized with COVID-19, with more than 200 in intensive care. As of Thursday morning, one in every five intensive care beds across the state was occupied by a COVID-19 patient, said Dr. Rahul Koranne, president of the Minnesota Hospital Association.\\n\\n“The community spread that we are seeing is quite explosive, and that is directly translating into increasing number of COVID-19 patients that are hospitalized and increasing number of COVID-19 patients needing intensive care units,” he said. “That is definitely worrisome and something we are closely watching.”\\n\\nDr. Pritish Tosh, an infectious diseases expert and medical director for the Mayo Clinic’s pandemic preparedness efforts, said the healthcare system’s contingency planning revolves around space, staffing and supplies.\\n\\n___\\n\\nSPRINGFIELD, Ill. - Deaths from coronavirus illness in Illinois topped a grim mark Thursday. With 97 additional deaths from COVID-19, the state pushed past 10,000 fatalities since the pandemic reached the state in February.\\n\\nThat forbidding number was accompanied by another - a single-day record of 9,935 fresh infections from the highly contagious and potentially deadly coronavirus.\\n\\n“I cannot stress (enough) how important your individual actions are right now. What you do, what we all do, will determine how much worse the coming weeks will look,” Gov. J.B. Pritzker said at his daily coronavirus briefing in Chicago. “We are seeing record numbers of new COVID-19 cases across the state.\\n\\nThe daily total outpaced the previous record, set Saturday, by 26%. Since an autumn surge of COVID-19, has hammered Illinois, the eight highest daily totals of newly contracted cases have occurred in the last eight days.\\n\\n___\\n\\nALBUQUERQUE — New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham says the state is reporting its highest daily count for deaths related to the coronavirus pandemic.\\n\\nShe announced an additional 23 deaths during a public briefing Thursday, saying the statewide total now stands at more than 1,080. Like other states, New Mexico has been dealing with a surge of cases, higher positivity rates and more hospitalizations.\\n\\nLujan Grisham says people can’t get numb to the troubling data or the threat of the state’s health care system being overwhelmed.\\n\\nShe says this “dramatic, critical situation” is what state officials had been warning about.\\n\\n___\\n\\nOMAHA, Neb. - Gov. Pete Ricketts implored residents Thursday to follow Nebraska’s voluntary coronavirus safety guidelines as the number of new cases and hospitalizations surged, and he hinted that the state could reimpose some of the social distancing mandates that were lifted in September.\\n\\nHis comments came as the state’s top public health official warned that Nebraska needed to reduce the number of cases to avoid overwhelming hospitals.\\n\\nNebraska reported a record 1,828 new coronavirus cases on Wednesday and the number of daily hospitalizations soared to an all-time high of 698 on the same day, following a week of massive growth.\\n\\n___\\n\\nDES MOINES, Iowa - Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds is launching a media campaign to encourage people to act to reduce the state’s surging coronavirus infection numbers but won’t impose any mandates or enforce new rules.\\n\\nReynolds also said Thursday that the success of Republican candidates in the general election proves that most Iowans support her decision to not require masks and quickly end most restrictions on businesses.\\n\\n“I think the election reflects that Iowans somewhat agree with how we have handled not only COVID-19 but conservative fiscally responsible decisions that have been made,” she said.\\n\\nThe newspaper, television and radio advertising campaign will begin next week, Reynolds said. She didn’t specify how much it would cost nor the funding source.\\n\\nAlso Thursday, Iowa reported 4,562 new confirmed cases in the past 24 hours and 20 more deaths.\\n\\nThe seven-day rolling average of the positivity rate in Iowa has risen over the past two weeks from 26% on Oct. 21 to over 39% on Nov. 4, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University. Iowa’s rate is second in the nation behind South Dakota.\\n\\nReynold attributed the rapid spread to Iowans growing weary of changing their lives to slow transmission.\\n\\n“What is honestly happening is people are just experiencing pandemic fatigue,” she said.\\n\\n___\\n\\nSALT LAKE CITY - Gov. Gary Herbert says he is “frustrated” as new coronavirus cases and hospitalizations continue a streak of record highs in Utah.\\n\\nHerbert says state health experts project the numbers will continue to rise dramatically and overwhelm hospitals if people don’t modify their behavior.\\n\\nThe state recorded 2,807 more confirmed cases of the coronavirus, bringing the seven-day average of new cases to 1,943.\\n\\nAccording to state data, Utah’s positivity average has increased from 18.1% to 19.5% in the past week.\\n\\n___\\n\\nINDIANAPOLIS - Indiana has notched a single-day high of new COVID-19 cases for the second straight day.\\n\\nThe state surpassed 4,000 new cases Thursday for the first time, and coronavirus hospitalizations also surged to a new high.\\n\\nRepublican Gov. Eric Holcomb, who has resisted calls to reinstate restrictions he largely lifted in September, said following his landslide reelection that he’s not making any changes to state policy on the pandemic.\\n\\nThe 4,462 new COVID-19 cases the Indiana State Department of Health reported Thursday were the state’s highest since the pandemic hit.\\n\\nIndiana also had 1,948 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 as of Wednesday, the most since officials began releasing those counts last spring.\\n\\nState health officials added 45 more coronavirus-related deaths Thursday, raising the overall toll to 4,511 including confirmed and presumed infections.\\n\\n___\\n\\nPROVIDENCE, R.I. - Gov. Gina Raimondo has issued an advisory aimed at keeping people home late at night and other new restrictions to slow the increasing spread of coronavirus in Rhode Island.\\n\\nStarting Sunday, the Democrat says, residents will be asked to remain at home from 10 p.m. until the next morning. Restaurants, bars, gyms and other businesses must end in-person service at 10 p.m.\\n\\nState health officials are reporting more than 500 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 and eight additional deaths.\\n\\n___\\n\\nJUNEAU, Alaska - Alaska’s state labor department will begin distributing an additional $300 a week per person in jobless benefits for a period dating back to the summer after technical challenges complicated the pandemic relief program’s rollout.\\n\\nThe department says it will start distributing the funds Friday. The program applies to people who were eligible for at least $100 in weekly unemployment benefits from the week ending Aug. 1 to the week ending Sept. 5.\\n\\nPatsy Westcott, director of the department’s Division of Employment and Training Services, said an estimated 35,000 Alaskans are expected to benefit.\\n\\nAn executive order by President Donald Trump allowed for Federal Emergency Management Agency funding for states to provide the extra $300-a-week benefit after a $600-a-week benefit approved by Congress expired.\\n\\n___\\n\\nOKLAHOMA CITY - New coronavirus cases and hospitalizations have reached single-day highs in Oklahoma.\\n\\nThe State Department of Health reported 2,101 new cases and 1,055 hospitalizations, nearly 400 more cases than the previous high from July and surpassing the 1,026 hospitalizations reported Wednesday.\\n\\nThe department also reported 21 more COVID-19 deaths.\\n\\nDr. George Monks, president of the Oklahoma State Medical Association, says the state is seeing “the worst hospital crisis we’ve ever had.”\\n\\nThe association and other medical groups have repeatedly urged Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt to impose some kind of mask mandate, but he has resisted, citing concerns about how such an order would be enforced.\\n\\n___\\n\\nROME - Italy has recorded a new daily high of 34,505 confirmed coronavirus cases.\\n\\nThe health ministry also reported 428 deaths Thursday, the highest since May.\\n\\nThe previous day, the country announced four two-week regional “red zone” lockdowns to ease pressure on hospitals and allow for more effective contact tracing.\\n\\nItaly, formerly the European epicenter of the pandemic, has seen a resurgence of the coronavirus with more than 790,000 confirmed cases and over 39,000 deaths, the sixth highest worldwide.\\n\\n___\\n\\nMONTGOMERY, Ala. - Alabama is extending through Dec. 11 an order requiring face masks in public but lifting business occupancy limits despite worsening hospitalizations and deaths.\\n\\nOccupancy caps are ending for retailers headed into the holiday shopping season, along with entertainment spots and fitness centers. Businesses including restaurants, hair salons and barbershops won’t have to follow the 6-foot social distancing requirement if people wear masks and are separated by a barrier or partition.\\n\\nThe 1,848 new cases reported Wednesday were the most for the state since early August. More than 1,020 patients were hospitalized with COVID-19, an increase of 45% since late September.\\n\\nAlabama’s total cases surpassed 200,000 and the death toll topped 3,000 this week.\\n\\n___\\n\\nPORTLAND, Maine - Maine’s governor has issued an executive order requiring people wear face coverings in public settings regardless of their ability to physically distance from others.\\n\\nJanet Mills, a Democrat, beefed up an earlier executive order mandating mask use when it’s difficult to maintain social distance.\\n\\nOwners and operators of public places must post signs notifying people they can be denied entry for non-compliance to the mask rule.\\n\\n___\\n\\nMADRID - Spain has nearly 22,000 new coronavirus infections and 368 deaths.\\n\\nThe country’s Health Ministry says COVID-19 patients occupy 16% of hospital beds, including 29% in ICUs. Spain has a 14-day average of 527 coronavirus cases per 100,000 people, one of the highest in Europe.\\n\\nThe ministry reports a total of nearly 1.3 million confirmed cases and almost 38,500 deaths.\\n\\n___\\n\\nGENEVA - Switzerland has surpassed 10,000 new coronavirus cases in the last day, putting the total at more than 200,000 since the start of the pandemic.\\n\\nSwiss health officials have expressed concerns about hospitals filling up, saying the impact of higher case counts generally takes about 10 days to translate into increased hospitalizations.\\n\\n___\\n\\nUNITED NATIONS - The U.N. will hold a summit Dec. 3-4 on the COVID-19 pandemic’s spread and its “unprecedented” effects on societies, economies, jobs, trade and travel.\\n\\nThe General Assembly voted 150-0 on Thursday to authorize the meeting, with the United States, Israel and Armenia abstaining.

       "  'text': 'In New York City, Zariely Garcia was surprised to see a $45 fee tacked onto a dental cleaning in July. It was billed to her directly, not her health plan, a practice that state regulators outlawed the next month as a violation of consumer protection laws.\\n\\nThe coronavirus pandemic has made the practice of health care more costly as providers must wear protective gear and sanitize equipment more often, even as they face declining revenue. Two groups of providers have been particularly hard hit. Dentists have lost billions since patients began postponing nonurgent dental care this spring. And assisted living facilities, grappling with lower overall demand, have also been forced to admit fewer residents to help stop the spread of infection.\\n\\nTo address this financial shortfall, some health providers are turning directly to patients. Surprise “Covid” and “PPE” fees have turned up across the country, in bills examined by The New York Times.\\n\\n“It’s a complicated answer, who pays for this,” says Scott Manaker, a physician who is in charge of the American Medical Association’s practice expense committee. “You look around the community and see additional costs being imposed right and left because of Covid-19. Barber shops, pedicures and restaurants all have additional charges. It would be an undue burden to ask the medical community to bear this alone.”\\n\\nSome of these fees — when millions of Americans are reeling after losing jobs and the health insurance that came with it — have drawn the attention of state attorneys general who say that charging patients directly can take advantage of vulnerable consumers or violate health insurance contracts and consumer protection laws. The new charges range from a couple of dollars to nearly $1,000.',\n",

With such big stresses going on, they are overriding the seasonal pattern.”\\n\\nDr. Rohan fears that the anxiety and stress provoked by the pandemic will increase the risk and severity of winter depression for everyone. “It’s possible that those with subclinical SAD will become clinical,” she said. “People will be limited in what they can do to stay well even if they normally have good coping resources.”\\n\\nHowever, Dr. Rosenthal said, “Just understanding the issues can give people a blueprint for handling them more effectively.” Most helpful for people with SAD, he said, is exposure to sunlight or its artificial equivalent for 20 to 30 minutes every morning. The standard amount of light needed is 10,000 lux. Sitting under a commercial light box at least one-foot square will do the job. Also helpful is using a dawn simulator in the bedroom or a light set on a timer to turn on 10 or 20 minutes before you get up.\\n\\nLIGHT THERAPY Wirecutter, a New York Times company, reviews light boxes here.\\n\\nMy late husband was helped by walking the dog for half an hour or so every morning after sunrise.\\n\\n“A 20-minute early morning walk in the sun is as good as commercial light therapy,” Dr. Rosenthal said, “but while morning is best, whenever you can do a walk is helpful. The combination of exercise and outdoor light is crucially important. It connects you with your environment — not just the light but also the birds, trees, animal life, neighborhood — all can act as an antidote to the cocoon of isolation.”\\n\\nOur conversation reminded me of the spirit-lifting tactics I had adopted during the devastating early months of the pandemic, when my city was the epicenter of Covid-19 infections, hospitalizations and deaths. I made a point of finding something every day that brought joy: new growth on neighborhood trees, emerging blooms in people’s yards, watching my dog play with his canine pals, flirting with toddlers on the street, doing an evening shout-out for our essential workers who put their lives on the line for the rest of us.\\n\\n“Don’t squeeze joy out of your life,” Dr. Rosenthal said emphatically. “There’s got to be joy every day. It’s an upfront investment that pays off handsomely.” He suggested taking classes online, perhaps learning to make jewelry or paint or play an instrument. Also very important is staying connected with people, perhaps by scheduling a socially distant lunch date or joining a friend for coffee or tea.',\n",

Is COVID-19 A Disease Of The Blood Vessels?\\n\\nEnlarge this image Jasmin Merdan/Getty Images Jasmin Merdan/Getty Images\\n\\nWhether it\\'s strange rashes on the toes or blood clots in the brain, the widespread ravages of COVID-19 have increasingly led researchers to focus on how the novel coronavirus sabotages the body\\'s blood vessels.\\n\\nAs scientists have come to know the disease better, they have homed in on the vascular system — the body\\'s network of arteries, veins and capillaries, stretching more than 60,000 miles — to understand this wide-ranging disease and to find treatments that can stymie its most pernicious effects.\\n\\nSome of the earliest insights into how COVID-19 can act like a vascular disease came from studying the aftermath of the most serious infections. Those reveal that the virus warps a critical piece of our vascular infrastructure: the single layer of cells lining the inside of every blood vessel, known as the endothelial cells or simply the endothelium.\\n\\nDr. William Li, a vascular biologist, compares this lining to a freshly resurfaced ice skating rink before a hockey game on which the players and pucks glide smoothly along.\\n\\n\"When the virus damages the inside of the blood vessel and shreds the lining, that\\'s like the ice after a hockey game,\" says Li, a researcher and founder of the Angiogenesis Foundation. \"You wind up with a situation that is really untenable for blood flow.\"\\n\\nIn a study published this summer, Li and an international team of researchers compared the lung tissues of people who died from COVID-19 with those who died from influenza.\\n\\nThey found stark differences: The lung tissues of COVID-19 patients had nine times as many tiny blood clots (\"microthrombi\\'\\') compared with those of the influenza patients, and the coronavirus-infected lungs also exhibited \"severe endothelial injury.\"\\n\\n\"The surprise was that this respiratory virus makes a beeline for the cells lining blood vessels, filling them up like a gumball machine and shredding the cell from the inside out,\" Li says. \"We found blood vessels are blocked and blood clots are forming because of that lining damage.\"\\n\\nIt\\'s already known that the coronavirus breaks into cells by way of a specific receptor, called ACE2, which is found all over the body. But scientists are still trying to understand how the virus sets off a cascade of events that cause so much destruction to blood vessels. Li says one theory is that the virus directly attacks endothelial cells. Lab experiments have shown that the coronavirus can infect engineered human endothelial cells.\\n\\nIt\\'s also possible the problems begin elsewhere, and the endothelial cells sustain collateral damage along the way as the immune system reacts — and sometimes overreacts — to the invading virus.\\n\\nEndothelial cells have a slew of important jobs; these include preventing clotting, controlling blood pressure, regulating oxidative stress and fending off pathogens. And Li says uncovering how the virus jeopardizes the endothelium may link many of COVID-19\\'s complications: \"The effects in the brain, the blood clots in the lung and elsewhere in the legs, the COVID toe, the problem with the kidneys and even the heart.\"\\n\\nIn Spain, skin biopsies of distinctive red lesions on toes, known as chilblains, found viral particles in the endothelial cells, leading the authors to conclude that \"endothelial damage induced by the virus could be the key mechanism.\"\\n\\nCould the lining of our blood vessels be a common denominator?\\n\\nWith a surface area larger than a football field, the endothelium helps maintain a delicate balance in the bloodstream. These cells are essentially the \"gatekeeper\" to the bloodstream.\\n\\n\"The endothelium has developed a distant early warning system to alert the body to get ready for an invasion if there\\'s trouble brewing,\" says Peter Libby, a cardiologist at Brigham and Women\\'s Hospital and research scientist at Harvard Medical School.\\n\\nWhen that happens, endothelial cells change the way they function, he says. But that process can also go too far.\\n\\n\"The very functions that help us maintain health and fight off invaders, when they run out of control, then it can actually make the disease worse,\" Libby says.\\n\\nIn that case, the endothelial cells turn against their host and start to promote clotting and high blood pressure.\\n\\n\"In COVID-19 patients, we have both of these markers of dysfunction,\" says Gaetano Santulli, a cardiologist and researcher at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City.\\n\\nThe novel coronavirus triggers a condition seen in other cardiovascular diseases called endothelial dysfunction. Santulli, who wrote about this idea in the spring, says that may be the \"cornerstone\" of organ dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.\\n\\n\"The common denominator in all of these COVID-19 patients is endothelial dysfunction,\" he says. \"It\\'s like the virus knows where to go and knows how to attack these cells.\"\\n\\nA runaway immune response adds a plot twist\\n\\nA major source of damage to the vascular system likely also comes from the body\\'s own runaway immune response to the novel coronavirus.\\n\\n\"What we see with the SARS-CoV-2 is really an unprecedented level of inflammation in the bloodstream,\" says Yogen Kanthi, a cardiologist and vascular medicine specialist at the National Institutes of Health, who\\'s researching this phase of the illness.\\n\\n\"This virus is leveraging its ability to create inflammation, and that has these deleterious, nefarious effects downstream.\"\\n\\nWhen inflammation spreads through the inner lining of the blood vessels — a condition called endothelialitis — blood clots can form throughout the body, starving tissues of oxygen and promoting even more inflammation.\\n\\n\"We start to get this relentless, self-amplifying cycle of inflammation in the body, which can then lead to more clotting and more inflammation,\" Kanthi says.\\n\\nAnother sign of endothelial damage comes from analyzing the blood of COVID-19 patients. A recent study found elevated levels of a protein produced by endothelial cells, called Von Willebrand factor, which is involved in clotting.\\n\\n\"They are through the roof in those who are critically ill,\" says Alfred Lee, a hematologist at the Yale Cancer Center, who coauthored the study with Hyung Chun, a cardiologist and vascular biologist at Yale.\\n\\nLee points out that some autoimmune diseases can lead to a similar interplay of clotting and inflammation called immunothrombosis.\\n\\nChun says the elevated levels of Von Willebrand factor show that vascular injury can be detected in patients while in the hospital — and perhaps even before, which could help predict their likelihood of developing more serious complications.\\n\\nBut he says it\\'s not yet clear what\\'s the driving force behind the blood vessel damage: \"It does seem to be a progression of disease that really brings out this endothelial injury; the key question is what\\'s the root cause of this?\"\\n\\nAfter they presented their data, Lee says Yale\\'s hospital system started putting patients who were critically ill with COVID-19 on aspirin, which can prevent clotting. While the best combinations and dosages are still being studied, research indicates that blood thinners may improve outcomes in COVID-19 patients.\\n\\nChun says treatments are also being studied that may more directly protect endothelial cells from the coronavirus.\\n\\n\"Is that the end-all be-all to treating COVID-19? I absolutely don\\'t think so. There\\'s so many aspects of the disease that we still don\\'t understand,\" he says.\\n\\nCOVID-19 as a vascular \\'\\'stress test\\'\\' for people with preexisting vascular problems\\n\\nEarly in the pandemic, Roger Seheult, a critical care and pulmonary physician in Southern California, realized the patients he expected to be most vulnerable to a respiratory virus, those with underlying lung conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma, were not the ones ending up disproportionately in his intensive care unit.\\n\\nSeheult, who runs the popular medical education website called MedCram, says, \"Instead, what we are seeing are patients who are obese, people who have large BMIs, people who have Type 2 diabetes and with high blood pressure.\"\\n\\nOver time, all of those conditions can cause inflammation and damage to the lining of blood vessels, he says, including a harmful chemical imbalance known as oxidative stress. Seheult says infection with the coronavirus becomes an added stress for people with those conditions that already tax the blood vessels.\\n\\n\"If you\\'re right on the edge and you get the wind blown from this coronavirus, now you\\'ve gone over the edge.\"\\n\\nHe says the extensive damage to blood vessels could explain why COVID-19 patients with severe respiratory problems don\\'t necessarily resemble patients who get sick from the flu.\\n\\n\"They are having shortness of breath, but we have to realize the lungs are more than just the airways,\" he says. \"It\\'s an issue with the blood vessels themselves.\"\\n\\nThis is why COVID-19 patients struggle to fill their blood supply with oxygen, even when air is being pumped into their lungs.\\n\\n\"The endothelial cells get leaky, so instead of being like Saran Wrap, it turns into a sieve and then it allows fluid from the bloodstream to accumulate in the airspaces,\" Harvard\\'s Libby says.\\n\\nDoctors who treat COVID-19 are now keenly aware that complications such as strokes and heart problems can appear, even after a patient gets better and their breathing improves.\\n\\n\"They are off oxygen, they can be discharged home, but their vasculature is not completely resolved, they still have inflammation,\" he says. \"What can happen is they develop a blood clot, and they have a massive pulmonary embolism.\"\\n\\nPatients can be closely monitored for these problems, but one of the big unknowns for doctors and patients are the long-term effects of COVID-19 on the circulatory system.\\n\\nThe Angiogenesis Foundation\\'s Li puts it this way: \"The virus enters your body and it leaves your body. You might or might not have gotten sick. But is that leaving behind a trashed vascular system?\"\\n\\nThis story comes from NPR\\'s partnership with Kaiser Health News.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Poor Countries Fall Behind In Race To Reserve COVID-19 Vaccine\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Adriana Adie/NurPhoto via Getty Images Adriana Adie/NurPhoto via Getty Images\\n\\nRich countries are rapidly claiming the world\\'s lion\\'s share of future doses of COVID-19 vaccine, creating deep inequalities in global distribution.\\n\\nDespite an international agreement to allocate the vaccine equitably around the world, billions of people in poor and middle-income countries might not be immunized until 2023 or even 2024, researchers at Duke University predict.\\n\\nOne reason is tied to the financial might of upper-income nations. The world has a limited capacity to manufacture any forthcoming COVID-19 vaccines each year. As of October, wealthy countries have claimed the vast majority of that capacity, leaving very little vaccine for low-income countries. Specifically, rich countries have already purchased, or are in the process of purchasing, more than 5 billion doses of candidate vaccines before clinical trials have completed. India has claimed another 1.6 billion doses, and Brazil has 200 million. Fewer than 800 million doses have been earmarked for the world\\'s poorest countries.\\n\\nNot all of the candidate vaccines will work. And so rich countries are hedging their bets by reserving more than one candidate, says Dr. Krishna Udayakumar, who led the study at Duke University.\\n\\nThis just-in-case strategy has an upside: \"It\\'s flooding investment into vaccine development and allowing many more candidates to be developed than otherwise would be possible,\" he says.\\n\\nBut the strategy also has a downside: It will likely greatly delay vaccine distribution in poor countries. \"We could be looking at two to four years before a general population in low-income countries really have a vaccine available,\" Udayakumar says.\\n\\nTo generate these predictions, Udayakumar and his colleagues pulled together all publicly available data about vaccine agreements between countries and pharmaceutical companies. Their findings, published last Thursday on the Web, point to glaring inequalities in acquiring the vaccine.\\n\\nSeveral countries, including the U.S., Canada and the U.K. as well as members of the EU, are reserving enough potential doses of different types of vaccines to immunize their entire populations several times before some poor countries have any vaccine at all. For example, the U.S. and the U.K. will potentially have enough to cover its population four times over. And Canada could have enough to immunize its population five times.\\n\\nAt the same time, several of these countries, including Canada and the U.K., recently joined an international initiative to help distribute the vaccine more equally around the world and to help bring vaccine to countries who can\\'t produce or purchase it themselves. (The U.S. hasn\\'t yet joined the agreement.)\\n\\nThat initiative, called COVAX, aims to have 2 billion doses available by the end of next year. So far, it has reserved about 740 million doses.\\n\\nBut there are potential stumbling blocks. There\\'s no guarantee those doses will work in many poor places, says Amanda Glassman, executive director of the Center for Global Development. Or that the countries in question will have the funds for any requested payment from COVAX.\\n\\n\"One concern that I have with COVAX is that it\\'s committed to purchasing vaccines that could be too expensive or inappropriate for low- and middle-income countries,\" Glassman says. For instance, the vaccine could require special freezers for storage or multiple doses to be effective.\\n\\n\"Hopefully, that doesn\\'t happen,\" she adds. \"But COVAX could possibly be stuck paying for some vaccine that would not be particularly usable in countries that need it.\"',\n",

They are cheap and fast, but experts said at the time they are also less accurate than the standard PCR test, which detects even the tiniest genetic trace of the virus.\\n\\n\\n\\nStill, Germany announced recently that it was bulk-buying millions of antigen tests each month.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"We have a new strategy,\" Chancellor Angela Merkel told reporters. \"We can now basically perform rapid tests on visitors to nursing and care homes.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nNursing homes will receive up to 20 free monthly tests per resident. These can be used to test patients, staff and - crucially - visiting relatives, who might be unwitting carriers of COVID-19.\\n\\n',\n",

But U.S. border agents quickly turned them back to Mexico.\\n\\nGrabriela, 13, hoped to apply for asylum when she reached the Texas border in April, just as her mother had done years earlier when she fled gangs in El Salvador. But after being apprehended by U.S. officials, the girl was detained in a hotel and then placed on a deportation flight.\\n\\nAfter waiting months in Mexico\\'s violence-plagued Ciudad Juárez for her U.S. court hearing, Elida allowed her 12-year-old son Gustavo to present himself to U.S. border officials, thinking he would be allowed to reunite with his grandfather in South Carolina. Instead, Gustavo, a largely non-verbal boy with physical and learning disabilities, was expelled to Guatemala alone.\\n\\nGet Breaking News Delivered to Your Inbox\\n\\nPrior to mid-March, these migrant children would have been housed in shelters and allowed to seek asylum or other forms of U.S. sanctuary with the help of lawyers. But their rapid expulsions from the U.S. are part of the Trump administration\\'s unprecedented efforts to use the COVID-19 pandemic as justification to sidestep legal protections for minors who arrive at America\\'s borders without documents.\\n\\nBy designating them public health threats who could spread the virus, the Trump administration has expelled at least 8,800 unaccompanied migrant children, some as young as 10, without a court hearing or asylum screening, circumventing safeguards Congress created to shield them from trafficking, exploitation and persecution.\\n\\nIn all, more than 204,000 of these expulsions have been carried out across the U.S.-Mexico border since March, according to government data.\\n\\nPresident Trump\\'s top immigration enforcement officials have portrayed the emergency policy as strictly based on public health and greenlighted by orders from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\\n\\nHowever, the White House and senior advisor Stephen Miller aggressively pressured the CDC to implement the order, bypassing objections from experts at the agency who believed there was no public health basis to invoke a 1940s law to shutter U.S. borders to migrants, including asylum-seekers and children, three former Trump administration officials familiar with the discussions told CBS News. The officials were granted anonymity in order to speak frankly about internal deliberations.\\n\\n\"We were forced to do it,\" one former official who worked on public health told CBS News. \"We exhausted all of the options. We delayed. We slow-rolled. We flat out said there\\'s not a public health justification. We said no. And then we were told, \\'Do it.\\' So, at the end of the day, your options are to resign in protest or sign it. And if you resign in protest, the next person is just going to do it anyways.\"\\n\\nA border patrol agent walks along a border wall separating Tijuana, Mexico, from San Diego, Wednesday, March 18, 2020, in San Diego. Gregory Bull / AP\\n\\nAccording to two of the former officials, career experts at the CDC\\'s Division of Global Migration and Quarantine — which would have jurisdiction over border measures to contain the virus — refused to be involved in the expulsions order. Instead, these former officials said, the order was drafted by Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) lawyer Brian Stimson, a political appointee. An HHS spokesperson said \"career and political attorneys\" who serve as lawyers for the CDC were involved because the order was a \"public health and legal matter.\"\\n\\nAfter mounting White House pressure, including a call from Vice President Mike Pence, CDC Director Robert Redfield signed the directive, which took effect on March 20. Katie Miller, a spokeswoman for Pence who is married to Miller, denied that the vice president \"directed the CDC on this issue.\"\\n\\n\"It was one of many tough choices that we were forced to make, and ultimately the White House and their preference prevailed,\" a second former public health official told CBS News. \"Public health authority had never been used in this way. A lot of folks, myself included, felt that this was a misappropriation of that authority.\"\\n\\nCDC officials initially were able to \"pare down\" the order so that it would have to be reauthorized every 30 days. In May, after two renewals, the order was extended indefinitely. A subsequent order issued last month will be in place until the CDC director determines \"the danger of further introduction of COVID-19 into the United States has ceased to be a serious danger.\"\\n\\n\"I guarantee you, under this administration, it will never happen,\" one of the former public health officials said. \"It will take a new administration, a new director to come in and say, \\'This is BS, I\\'m pulling it.\\'\"\\n\\nFor the first time, Joe Biden\\'s campaign on Sunday said the former vice president would order a review of the policy if elected. \"A Biden Administration would direct the CDC and DHS to review this policy and make the appropriate changes to ensure that people have the ability to submit their asylum claims while ensuring that we are taking the appropriate COVID-19 safety precautions, as guided by the science and public health experts,\" campaign spokesperson Pili Tobar told CBS News.\\n\\nThe Associated Press and The Wall Street Journal have also reported on the White House\\'s campaign to overrule CDC officials who opposed the border expulsions order.\\n\\nOn March 27, seven days after the CDC order took effect, Chad Mizelle, the top lawyer at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), sent a memo to Ken Cuccinelli, the second-in-command at the department, proposing to further restrict asylum eligibility based on the pandemic, according to documents obtained by the group Human Rights First under the Freedom of Information Act.\\n\\nIn a statement provided by the White House, Redfield said \"data pointed to a public health risk from COVID-19 to the illegal immigrants and the CPB employees at the border\" when the expulsions policy was being discussed. \"I determined it was in the public health interest, at that time, to issue the order and it was a decision I made as CDC Director,\" Redfield added. \"CDC continues to evaluate the situation on the border and our future decisions will also be led by the science and data at the border locations.\"\\n\\nA White House spokesman said the policy has \"saved countless American lives by protecting border states, including Texas and Arizona, from having their hospitals overwhelmed and border patrol agents from infection.\" Customs and Border Protection (CBP) also defended it.\\n\\n\"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention determined that the introduction and spread of COVID-19 in CBP stations and temporary holding facilities presents a danger to illegal border crossers, our frontline agents and officers, doctors and nurses, and the American public,\" the agency said in a statement to CBS News. \"It would take just a small number of individuals with COVID-19 to infect a large number of detainees and CBP personnel and potentially overwhelm local healthcare systems along the border.\"\\n\\nAsked during an interview with CBS News in September why U.S. immigration officials couldn\\'t exclude unaccompanied children from the expulsions policy, Cuccinelli said, \"You don\\'t gain the benefit of a public health order by filling it with exceptions.\"\\n\\n\"The rules are clear. The circumstances are extraordinary due to COVID, even in addition to the fact that people are traveling illegally,\" Cuccinelli said. \"I don\\'t know why anyone would expect anything other than quick removal from this country when they cross knowingly, illegally, no matter what their age.\"\\n\\n\"Patently unlawful\"\\n\\nChildren who set foot on U.S. soil without authorization have long been afforded additional legal protections.\\n\\nIn 2008, President George W. Bush signed the bipartisan Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act, which requires all government agencies to quickly transfer non-Mexican unaccompanied migrant children to the Office of Refugee Resettlement and its network of shelters. Under that law, Mexican children can be transferred to Mexican authorities after being screened to ensure they are not victims of trafficking or persecution.\\n\\nIn this Feb. 8, 2019 file photo, Salvadoran teen migrant Xiomara Henriquez Ayala peers over to the U.S. border fence from Tijuana, Mexico, looking for a way to help her companions cross undetected. Emilio Espejel / AP\\n\\nWhile in the custody of the refugee agency, which is a division of HHS, children are connected with lawyers and in certain cases, with child advocates. Unlike adults, they are protected from expedited deportations and can have their asylum requests adjudicated by officers trained to hear humanitarian protection claims, rather than before an immigration judge in an adversarial courtroom setting.\\n\\nIn addition to asylum, which is a humanitarian protection against persecution, migrant children can also be eligible to legalize their status in the U.S. through visas for neglected, abused or abandoned minors.\\n\\nWhile migrant children face deportation proceedings, the government is mandated to continuously pursue their release from custody by placing them with sponsors, who are typically family members residing in the U.S. These protections are established in U.S. law and the landmark Flores court settlement.\\n\\nThe Trump administration has denounced this patchwork of legal safeguards, arguing the protections encourage children from poor and often violence-plagued areas of Central America to journey north with the help of smugglers. Through different policies, the administration has sought to dismantle it.\\n\\nBut officials had never suspended these protections — until now. Citing the pandemic, the Trump administration has argued that migrant children are not entitled to these safeguards, and that the laws that created them are effectively inoperative as long as the CDC\\'s orders remain in place.\\n\\nThe administration has even stopped using the legal term \"unaccompanied alien children\" for underage migrants apprehended by border authorities without their parents and placed in expulsion proceedings. Officials have been calling them \"single minors,\" a change designed to reduce \"litigation liability risk,\" according to the CBP documents obtained by Human Rights First.\\n\\nTwo federal judges have questioned the legality of the expulsion policy, saying the government should be harmonizing public health laws with the legal safeguards Congress created for migrant children.\\n\\n\"The Trump administration\\'s use of the public health laws to summarily expel children without hearings is patently unlawful, as the two judges who have looked at the issue have concluded,\" Lee Gelernt, the American Civil Liberties Union attorney challenging the expulsions edict in court, told CBS News.\\n\\nCiting the CDC order, U.S. authorities have pushed 6,500 unaccompanied children back into Mexico. Hundreds of unaccompanied children and families were also held in border hotels by U.S. officials seeking to expel them via deportation flights until a federal judge banned the practice in September, citing in part the limited access to lawyers.\\n\\nIn recent weeks, border authorities have allowed more unaccompanied children to stay in the U.S. The Office of Refugee Resettlement took in 1,218 migrant minors in September, compared to the 39 it received in May. Its in-custody population has increased to nearly 2,000, after plummeting to 800 in the summer.\\n\\nAttorneys believe the increased referrals to the U.S. refugee agency stem from their efforts to stop the expulsions of the children they are able to locate, as well as the court-mandated ban on hotel detention, which hinders DHS\\' ability to house minors waiting to be placed on deportation flights.\\n\\nThe U.S., however, continues to expel unaccompanied children. In October, Guatemala, the largest source of non-Mexican migration to the U.S. southern border, reported receiving 407 unaccompanied and underage deportees, compared to 230 in September and 254 in August. And apprehensions of unaccompanied minors at the U.S.-Mexico border have increased steadily since the spring, reaching nearly 4,000 in September.\\n\\nAdvocates fear the U.S. government will continue citing public health laws to expel them.\\n\\n\"The policies that the administration has adopted, which are supposedly meant to address COVID-19, are based on totally spurious justifications,\" Kennji Kizuka, a senior researcher at Human Rights First, told CBS News. \"They have nothing to do with protecting public health and everything to do with blocking asylum-seekers and unaccompanied children from getting the protections that Congress created for them.\"\\n\\n\"We have no safety here\"\\n\\nAfter being turned back by U.S. border officials, Noeli, Valeria and Josue, the expelled Salvadoran siblings, were shuffled around Mexico by immigration authorities there, ultimately ending up in a government holding facility in the southern state of Veracruz.\\n\\nEvelin, their mother in Maryland, said she frantically made all the calls she could and eventually reached a Salvadoran consular official in Veracruz who helped facilitate the release of her children. She had her daughters go back to the U.S. border, saying they were not going to be safe in El Salvador, where they don\\'t have immediate family members to care for them. Evelin said her adult son, Josue, did not cross with them out of fear that it would lead to the siblings being expelled to Mexico again.\\n\\nIn a 2 a.m. phone call, Evelin said U.S. officials told her that her daughters were going to be expelled yet again — this time to El Salvador. But with the help of the Young Center for Immigrant Children\\'s Rights and other U.S.-based advocates, the girls were instead transferred to the U.S. refugee agency. They spent a month in two Texas shelters before being released to Evelin on September 24.\\n\\n\"I was very emotional to see them again,\" Evelin told CBS News in Spanish. \"That has been my fight, to see them again and to make sure nothing happened to them in El Salvador. I\\'m happy to have them here. They suffered a lot. How did they send them like that to Mexico? They suffered a lot there, during the trip, facing hunger.\"\\n\\nDespite their experiences in Mexico, Evelin\\'s girls are some of the lucky few. They are the migrant children found by an \"underground railroad\" network of immigration lawyers, human rights activists and child advocates who support humanitarian-centered border policies.\\n\\n\"Migrant children facing expulsion stand no chance of being allowed to stay in the U.S. without legal representation,\" Taylor Levy, an immigration attorney in El Paso, told CBS News. \"I worked on the case of a teenage boy fleeing death threats following the murder of his live-in uncle; he was expelled mere hours before we reached out to the government after becoming aware of his case, without ever having the chance to seek asylum.\"\\n\\nGabriela, the 13-year-old girl expelled to El Salvador, is hiding from gangs, according to lawyers with the Texas Civil Rights Project who are in communication with her New York-based mother. The Texas non-profit filed a lawsuit in federal court in June to try to secure Gabriela\\'s return to the U.S. but the case has stalled.\\n\\nGustavo, 12, poses for a photo with his father, Juan. The 12-year-old boy was expelled from the U.S. southern border in August.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Gustavo, the 12-year-old disabled boy, is back in Petén, one of the most poverty-stricken parts of Guatemala where local authorities are often unable or unwilling to stop violent crime.\\n\\nGustavo\\'s parents were never notified by U.S. officials of their son\\'s expulsion. They said they located him through a Facebook post and help from the Los Angeles-based Immigrant Defenders Law Center. \"He didn\\'t deserve this,\" Juan, Gustavo\\'s father, told CBS News in Spanish.\\n\\nJuan, a farmer, said he does not know how he will escape the vicious cycle of poverty that traps many poor Guatemalans. Now that Gustavo is back, Juan said he also fears for his son\\'s safety, citing recent roadside killings of two family members.\\n\\n\"We have no safety here. The authorities don\\'t do anything in our country,\" Juan said. \"They kill over anything here. That\\'s why we look for a safer country.\"\\n\\nHundreds of miles away, Elida cried when recounting her decision to let Gustavo cross the U.S. border while she remained in Ciudad Juárez, where she said he was almost kidnapped. She is waiting for her U.S. asylum hearing, which has been postponed indefinitely due to the pandemic.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know what I\\'m going to do,\" Elida said while sobbing. \"I don\\'t want to be here without my son.\"',\n",

       "  'text': 'Illustration picture shows a Covid-19 patient transferred by helicopter from the CHU hospital in Liege to Koln, Germany. ERIC LALMAND | AFP | Getty Images\\n\\nLONDON — The coronavirus pandemic is hitting Belgium particularly hard, with intensive care units at full capacity in Brussels. Belgium, where the main EU institutions are based, is experiencing some of the highest Covid-19 daily infections in Europe. When adjusted for population, the figures are twice as much as France and seven times more than Germany over the last two weeks, data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control shows. In late October, the country\\'s health minister, Frank Vandenbroucke, described the situation as being like a \"tsunami\" of infections where the authorities are \"no longer in control.\" It is a \"big failure\" compared to other European countries, Pieter Cleppe, a fellow at Property Rights Alliance and a resident of Belgium, told CNBC over the phone.\\n\\nPolitics\\n\\nOne of the reasons behind the crisis is the conflict between regional and federal leaders. Belgium has a unique configuration, divided into three communities (the French, the German and the Flemish) and three regions (the Brussels-capital region, and the Flemish and Walloon regions). They share various policy portfolios, for instance, while communities oversee education, regions have a say on economic affairs.\\n\\nDuring the health crisis, politicians in the Flemish-speaking part and their counterparts in the French speaking regions have clashed over the right balance between containing the virus and avoiding further economic pain. Alexander de Croo, who was appointed prime minister in late September, has tried to bring the nation together in the fight against Covid-19. He has asked \"a team of 11 million Belgians\" — the country\\'s population — to beat the pandemic \"together.\"\\n\\nThe Chaussée d\\'Ixelles, a commercial street of Brussels is seen nearly empty on November 3, 2020. Thierry Monasse | Getty Images News | Getty Images\\n\\nDe Croo announced a second nationwide lockdown earlier this week to last a least until the middle of December. Speaking on Wednesday, he said that \"strict measures\" will remain in place until there is a vaccine, The Brussels Times reported. But Belgium\\'s hardship goes beyond that division.\\n\\nTesting and high population density\\n\\nSimon Dellicour, a bioengineer and research associate at the Universite Libre de Bruxelles, said the recent spike in cases is due to a \"relatively high population density,\" increased testing capacity and a rapid relaxation of the rules at the end of the summer. In comparison with neighboring nations such as France and Germany, Belgium has a much higher number of people per square kilometer, which raises challenges when imposing social distancing.\\n\\nFast relaxation of the rules\\n\\n\"At the end of the summer,\" he said, \"we reopened kindergartens, elementary schools and high schools at the same time and people were regularly going back to work.\" \"Everything combined, we let the situation get worse and worse,\" Dellicour added. During the first wave of cases in spring, the country also imposed one of the strictest lockdowns in Europe, where police monitored non-essential travel. This second wave is causing a much higher number of reported daily cases than in March and April. But, the number of deaths per day is smaller than in spring, at the peak of the first wave, data from John Hopkins University shows.',\n",

Stefano Mazzola | Awakening | Getty Images\\n\\nLONDON — The key to improving compliance with coronavirus health measures lies in effective communication between policymakers and the broader population, infectious disease experts have said. It comes as several European countries seek to impose fresh lockdown measures to tackle the spread of the disease, almost eight months after the WHO first declared Covid-19 a pandemic. Countries including the U.K., Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Belgium, and the Netherlands have all moved to reintroduce strict health measures as Covid-19 infections continue to rise. The government-imposed restrictions have sparked at times violent clashes across the region in recent days. It appears to reflect a growing sense of frustration with governments\\' responses to the pandemic, and amid concern the draconian measures are likely to remain in place for some time. \"We have, in many nations, had strict restrictive measures for very many months and we don\\'t see them ending. We know now that we are going to have to start living with this virus in a more chronic way — really, in the long term,\" said Dr. Olivia Tulloch, CEO of Anthrologica, a leading research-based specialist in applied anthropology in global health. \"And so, people feel fatigue, confusion, and frustration to do with the measures that are being directed at them. People look at the measures that are designed to protect them and they can see that they start to undermine other parts of their existence,\" Tulloch said during a webinar for think tank Chatham House last month. \"If you are in a place where the messages are changing and are not consistent or it has been heavily politicized, I think you do see that trust and willingness to comply can be undermined.\"\\n\\nSocial contract\\n\\nThe situation has reignited a debate about how policymakers can try to reach out to so-called Covid \"refuseniks\" — those who refuse to comply with the public health measures expected of them. That\\'s because some choose to ignore recommendations from policymakers and the United Nations health agency due to a perception that the measures represent an assault on their personal freedom or economic wellbeing.\\n\\nWe have to make sure that those people who feel strongly about an issue are heard … because it is only through dialogue between a government and its people that things can become better. Dr. David Heymann Professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology at LSHTM\\n\\nTo be sure, the WHO recommends people protect themselves and others by wearing a mask, practicing physical distancing, keeping rooms well ventilated, avoiding crowds, washing their hands, and following any further local advice. \"In the short term, there might have been real willingness to follow the advice and the guidance that we had in the earlier days of the pandemic but that\\'s waning because there are other things, like access to other social and welfare and health services, or access to families, or the ability to earn a living,\" Tulloch said. To date, more than 48.7 million people have contracted the coronavirus worldwide, with 1.23 million related deaths, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.\\n\\nA paramedic wheels a woman out of an ambulance outside the Burgos Hospital in Burgos, northern Spain, on October 21, 2020, on the first day of a two week lockdown in an attempt to limit the contagion of the new coronavirus COVID-19 in the area. Cesar Manso | AFP | Getty Images\\n\\nDr. David Heymann, who led the WHO\\'s infectious disease unit during the SARS epidemic in 2002-2003, identified two critically important tools for policymakers seeking to ensure as many people as possible abide by the rules: messaging and the tradition of the society. \"We have to make sure that those people who feel strongly about an issue are heard … because it is only through dialogue between a government and its people that things can become better,\" Heymann said during the same webinar event. \"The natural tendency of humans is to defy when there is something that they feel is infringing on their personal space or their rights. And so, it is a very difficult activity for a government to help make a social contract if they are going to be too authoritarian.\"\\n\\nData and statistics\\n\\nOne common mistake among policymakers around the world, Heymann and Tulloch agreed, was an overreliance on data and statistics when emphasizing the importance of following the latest public health measures. \"We can use the example that in some cases we have become very familiar with this term the \\'R\\' number, as if this is a concept that everybody should be able to absorb and understand and we hear it all of the time,\" she said, adding this term \"very often\" just confuses people. The so-called \"R\" number, or rate, refers to the number of secondary infections generated from one infected individual, on average, assuming there is no immunity among a population already. Put simply, it gives experts an indication of the extent to which the coronavirus is being spread, or reproduced, among a population. The higher the reproduction rate, the higher the risk of a virus spreading exponentially.\\n\\n(L-R) Britain\\'s Chief Scientific Adviser Patrick Vallance, Britain\\'s Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Dr. Susan Hopkins of NHS Test and Trace and Public Health England attend a virtual press conference inside 10 Downing Street in central London on October 16, 2020.

       "  'text': '(CNN) The United States set a new record on Friday when it surpassed 125,000 daily coronavirus infections, while Covid-19 hospitalizations continued to climb, prompting health experts to issue dire predictions.\\n\\nFriday saw at least 125,596 new coronavirus cases -- the highest single day reporting since the pandemic began. It also marked the third straight day the country has surpassed 100,000 daily coronavirus cases.\\n\\nBesides the new case numbers, by Friday evening there had been at least 1,137 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University.\\n\\nAdditionally, more than 54,000 Americans are hospitalized with Covid-19, with about 11,000 of them in intensive care, according to the COVID Tracking Project.\\n\\nOfficials around the nation are warning that hospitals could soon run out of capacity. And more hospitalizations and people in intensive care could also lead to a rise in deaths.\\n\\nHarvard University epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch warned on Friday that coronavirus infections could double over the next month. And an ensemble forecast by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention projects another 31,000 people could lose their lives over the next two-and-a-half weeks.\\n\\nStates are seeing record high numbers\\n\\nIn a week with record nationwide case numbers , many states also reported all-time highs.\\n\\nThirteen states reported their highest numbers of new cases on Thursday, according to Johns Hopkins: Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Utah and West Virginia.\\n\\nAnd at least 38 states are reporting more new infections than the previous week. Only two states -- Alabama and Tennessee -- are trending in the right direction.\\n\\nAt least 236,064 Americans have died from Covid-19, and there have been at least 9,732,932 US coronavirus cases since the pandemic\\'s start, Johns Hopkins University data show\\n\\nHospitals are reaching capacity\\n\\nSixteen states reported record high Covid-19 hospitalizations on Friday, according to the Covid Tracking Project.\\n\\nThose states are: Alaska, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, Utah, Wisconsin and Wyoming.\\n\\nIn Kansas City, hospitals are reaching capacity because of the strain of Covid-19, officials say.\\n\\nChief medical officers from seven hospital systems told reporters that city hospitals could be overwhelmed in a matter of weeks. They said that hospitalizations in the region were at their highest levels since the pandemic started.\\n\\nA major concern, they added, is that there wouldn\\'t be enough staffing at hospitals to support patients with the virus.\\n\\n\"Covid is the leading admission diagnosis\" at the University of Kansas, said Dr. Steven Stites, chief medical director at the University of Kansas Health System.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Colorado\\'s Department of Health and Environment said Friday that the newest Covid-19 model indicates state hospitalizations are increasing more sharply than last week\\'s projections.\\n\\nThe state has reached its greatest number of Covid-19 hospitalizations to date, surpassing its peak in April, the department said in a news release.\\n\\n\"Keeping hospitals at or below demand capacity will require substantial and rapid action to prevent transmission,\" according to the release.\\n\\nNew state restrictions include curfews\\n\\nAs the situation around the country worsens, state and local officials are taking new steps to prevent the spread of the virus -- despite the fatigue that many are feeling.\\n\\nOfficials in Rhode Island, Oregon and Denver, for example, are recommending nightly curfews.\\n\\nOn Friday, Denver officials announced a 10 p.m. curfew for residents and nonexempt businesses -- a last-ditch effort to curb rising cases and avoid another citywide stay-at-home order.\\n\\nThe curfew, which Mayor Michael Hancock called a \"Home By 10 Order,\" goes into effect on Sunday and will last 30 days. It differs slightly from a traditional curfew because it came from the city\\'s health department rather than the mayor\\'s office.\\n\\nThat means that public health officials will enforce the order rather than law enforcement.\\n\\nOregon Gov. Kate Brown called on some counties to take a two week \"social pause,\" as the state reported a record 805 new cases on Friday.\\n\\nThe \"social pause\" limits indoor social gatherings to single households or a maximum or 6 people, and limits indoor recreation spaces such as gyms and museums to 50 people. Restaurants will be required to limit capacity to 50 people with a maximum group size of people sitting together at six.\\n\\nStarting November 11, counties that are recording 200 cases per 100,000 people over a two week period will be required to follow the \"social pause,\" Brown said.\\n\\n\"This is a wake-up call,\" she said. \"I don\\'t want to have to take further actions to stop the spread of COVID-19, because I know it will have a devastating impact on our businesses both large and small, but I absolutely will.\"\\n\\nRhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo announced a stay-at-home advisory that will last from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. on weeknights and will begin at 10:30 p.m. on Friday and Saturday. That advisory, one of several new restrictions, also takes effect on Sunday.\\n\\nGatherings such as house parties have been the main source of virus spread in the state, the governor added. And if those don\\'t stop, she said, \"I will be back in two weeks with a shutdown order.\"\\n\\nSocial distancing earlier might have prevented 59,000 deaths\\n\\nMore than 1 million US Covid-19 cases and more than 59,000 deaths could have been prevented by early May if mitigation steps had been implemented two weeks earlier, according to a modeling study published Friday in Science Advances.\\n\\nSen Pei, a research scientist at Columbia University, and colleagues built a Covid-19 transmission model that looked at all US counties from February 21 through May 3.\\n\\nBroad coronavirus transmission control measures were announced March 15, researchers wrote. But had interventions such as social distancing and business closures started a week earlier on March 8, there would have been 600,000 fewer confirmed cases and 32,000 fewer deaths.\\n\\nIf those interventions started two weeks earlier, on March 1, there would have been more than a million fewer confirmed cases and more than 59,000 fewer deaths, the authors found.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Elizabeth Yuko, Ph.D., is a bioethicist and writer whose work has appeared in The New York Times, Rolling Stone, The Washington Post, The Atlantic and elsewhere. She is also an adjunct professor at Fordham University. The views expressed here are hers. Read more opinion on CNN.\\n\\n(CNN) While the presidential candidates spent November 2 making their final stops on the campaign trail, I glanced at my calendar between assignments and realized it was my seven-month anniversary of living with long-term Covid-19 . (In case you\\'re wondering, the traditional gift for this milestone is a heating pad.)\\n\\nThere are more than two outcomes following a Covid-19 diagnosis. In addition to dying from the virus or recovering completely, tens of thousands of us form another category completely: those with symptoms that stick around for several months (at least), potentially resulting in permanent physical and/or neurological damage, some type of chronic condition, or both. It\\'s too early to know for sure\\n\\nEach long-termer, including myself, has their own unique set of symptoms that appear in various combinations. For instance, mine include, but are not limited to: a constant accelerated heart rate, loss of depth perception, a variety of gastrointestinal issues (I\\'ll spare you the details), hair loss, brain fog, extreme fatigue that never goes away, an impressive assortment of skin rashes, nighttime hallucinations and joint pain.\\n\\nMeanwhile, President Donald Trump\\'s own experience with Covid-19 , by his account, appears to have gone more smoothly than humanly possible. Before leaving Walter Reed Medical Center after only 72 hours of treatment, he tweeted that he felt better than he did 20 years ago, then returned to the White House for his grand finale: triumphantly whipping off his face mask from the balcony, channeling both Eva Peron and P.T. Barnum.\\n\\nIn the same October 5 tweet, Trump also told his followers not to be afraid of Covid-19, or \"let it dominate your life.\" As someone whose life has been dominated by this virus for more than half of 2020, I found his message not only ignorant and inaccurate, but also harmful. At a point when basic public health measures, like wearing face masks, were already politicized (with Trump\\'s followers overwhelmingly against them), the last thing we needed was messaging from the President asserting falsely that the novel coronavirus, which has now claimed the lives of more than 234,000 people in the United States, was not a serious threat.\\n\\nStill, in what turned out to be nothing more than wishful thinking, I held out (a tiny bit of) hope when it came to the election; specifically, that people would take the magnitude of the pandemic into account before casting their ballot for someone who has repeatedly demonstrated that he doesn\\'t have the capacity to understand it, let alone the capability to handle it. The alternative would have been acknowledging that, for a significant number of Americans, the lives of those with Covid-19 -- a disproportionate number of whom are people of color -- lack value in comparison with their own. Even for a pessimist, that\\'s pretty dark.\\n\\nAs I watched the election results trickle in Tuesday night and the counting continue through the week, it became evident that no matter who wins, public health has suffered a major loss. The close race indicates that a substantial number of voters opted to support someone whose dangerous messaging on Covid-19 will only make the pandemic worse -- never mind making any progress in slowing its spread. And that\\'s in addition to the votes of confidence for someone who responded to demonstrations for racial justice with words and policies that further entrenched the systemic racism activists and communities of color have spent this year (and centuries before it) working to dismantle.\\n\\nOf course, that\\'s not to say that everyone who voted for Trump lacks either the most basic understanding of public health, the willingness to cooperate with preventative measures, or both. But it does lead me to believe that ensuring that as many people as possible make it through the pandemic alive isn\\'t necessarily their priority. (That would be the economy, according to the results of a nationwide CNN exit poll .)\\n\\nThe same CNN exit poll data reinforces the partisan split over the coronavirus, indicating that while more than four in five people who voted for former Vice President Joe Biden said that efforts to contain the pandemic are going badly, only one in 10 Trump supporters felt the same way. Additionally, only half of Trump supporters said that they view wearing a face mask as a public health responsibility more than as a personal choice (compared to more than four in five Biden voters).\\n\\nOn the one hand, it\\'s reassuring to hear that half of Trump supporters do understand the reasoning behind wearing face masks during a pandemic. But on the other hand, just based on the over 68 million votes Trump had at the time of writing, that\\'s potentially more than 34 million people who don\\'t -- a number high enough that it likely includes people who were impacted by Covid-19 themselves.\\n\\nJUST WATCHED Ozarks public health workers feel \\'hated\\' in Covid-19 spike Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Ozarks public health workers feel \\'hated\\' in Covid-19 spike 03:39\\n\\nThose public officials charged with promoting and maintaining public health must not let the election or its aftermath deter them from the hard truth that those 34 million -- and others who are suffering from understandable Covid-19 fatigue -- are where they must place their focus in the weeks and months to come. A staggeringly difficult road lies ahead, and it\\'s imperative that we prioritize scientifically accurate messaging and emphasize the necessity for Americans to look out for each other.\\n\\nGiven the extent of public buy-in required for public health interventions -- like masking and social distancing -- to work, we need far more people to actively participate if we hope to slow the spread of the virus. Holding out on wearing a mask under the assumption that a safe and effective vaccine will soon be readily available is not a strategy; it\\'s reckless and puts lives at risk.\\n\\nAt the same time, this perspective does make sense in the context of traditional American cultural values. The whitewashed narrative of the country\\'s history so many of us are taught in school stresses the importance of our individual liberties and freedoms, but the lesson in rights and values too often seems to end there, leaving people to assume that they always and automatically override everything else.\\n\\nBut public health is different. It challenges that notion by asking people to temporarily limit some aspects of their personal autonomy in favor of the health of the wider population. For some, this is a major shift in mindset, and not one that happens overnight (or, evidently, in eight months).\\n\\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion\\'s new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\\n\\nThat\\'s what makes reliable, accurate public health messaging, which Trump is clearly unwilling to embrace, a matter of life and death right now. With new cases rising in multiple regions, high rates of asymptomatic spread and all available indicators on the pandemic pointing in a grim direction as we head toward winter, disseminating a message about how to counter the spread -- and getting Americans to heed it for themselves and for others -- should be our country\\'s top priority.\\n\\nNo matter who is inaugurated in January 2021, the fact remains that there are still tens of millions of people who voted for a candidate who is himself a threat to public health. Whether or not you\\'ve personally dealt with the virus and its aftermath, that is terrifying. And that\\'s on top of the current forecast for a particularly bleak winter, with at least three more months of Trump presiding over the pandemic. With Covid-19 cases continuing to increase across the country and flu season already underway, this does not bode well for any of us.',\n",

Instead, he said, they went their own ways as infections moved “every way, everywhere.”\\n\\nThe U.N. chief recalled that at the March meeting he urged adoption of a “wartime” plan including a stimulus package “in the trillions of dollars” for businesses, workers and households in developing countries trying to tackle the pandemic, and “a task force to have a combined effort to defeat the virus.”\\n\\nThe G20 is holding a virtual summit on Nov. 21-22 and Guterres said the United Nations will be “strongly advocating” for better coordination and seeking a “guarantee” that any coronavirus vaccine is treated as “a global public good” and be made “available and affordable for everyone, everywhere.”\\n\\nU.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said the secretary-general “very much” hopes the U.N. summit soon after that will be an opportunity “for states to move forward together on facing the virus, both in the immediate-term and the longer term.”\\n\\nThe General Assembly resolution, whose negotiations were led by Azerbaijan and Canada, was put to a vote after three proposed amendments were defeated.\\n\\nOne by the United States would have eliminated a reference to the World Health Organization, which President Donald Trump withdrew from over the U.N. agency’s handling of the pandemic and his allegations that the WHO has been improperly influenced by China.\\n\\nAn amendment proposed by Israel would have eliminated a reference to U.N. “observer states,” which include Palestine. The proposed amendment by Armenia would have eliminated a reference to the 120-member Nonaligned Movement, which initiated the call for a special session.\\n\\nThe resolution adopted Thursday recognizes the need for a global response to the pandemic “that is people-centered, gender-responsive, with full respect for human rights, multidimensional, coordinated, inclusive and innovative, based on unity, solidarity and multilateral cooperation.”\\n\\nIt notes “the fundamental role of the United Nations system in the comprehensive global response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the crucial role played by the World Health Organization.”\\n\\nThe meeting is to include prerecorded speeches by heads of state and government of the 193 U.N. member nations, the observer states of Palestine and the Holy See, and “time permitting” a limited number of non-governmental organizations.\\n\\nDiplomats said a proposal to have WHO chief Ghebreyesus speak at the opening was dropped during negotiations, but he will make a presentation and lead a dialogue during the summit’s second day. There will not be a final joint statement.\\n\\n“The point of this special session is first of all to bring the membership together and to move forward collectively in fighting the pandemic,” General Assembly spokesman Brenden Varma said after the vote. “It’s also an opportunity to come and identify the gaps that exist right now in our response to the pandemic.”\\n\\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\\n\\nCopyright © 2020 The Washington Times, LLC.',\n",

But their rapid expulsions from the U.S. are part of the Trump administration\\'s unprecedented efforts to use the COVID-19 pandemic as justification to sidestep legal protections for minors who arrive at America\\'s borders without documents.\\n\\nBy designating them public health threats who could spread the virus, the Trump administration has expelled at least 8,800 unaccompanied migrant children, some as young as 10, without a court hearing or asylum screening, circumventing safeguards Congress created to shield them from trafficking, exploitation and persecution.\\n\\nIn all, more than 204,000 of these expulsions have been carried out across the U.S.-Mexico border since March, according to government data.\\n\\nPresident Trump\\'s top immigration enforcement officials have portrayed the emergency policy as strictly based on public health and greenlighted by orders from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\\n\\nHowever, the White House and senior advisor Stephen Miller aggressively pressured the CDC to implement the order, bypassing objections from experts at the agency who believed there was no public health basis to invoke a 1940s law to shutter U.S. borders to migrants, including asylum-seekers and children, three former Trump administration officials familiar with the discussions told CBS News. The officials were granted anonymity in order to speak frankly about internal deliberations.\\n\\n\"We were forced to do it,\" one former official who worked on public health told CBS News. \"We exhausted all of the options. We delayed. We slow-rolled. We flat out said there\\'s not a public health justification. We said no. And then we were told, \\'Do it.\\' So, at the end of the day, your options are to resign in protest or sign it. And if you resign in protest, the next person is just going to do it anyways.\"\\n\\nA border patrol agent walks along a border wall separating Tijuana, Mexico, from San Diego, Wednesday, March 18, 2020, in San Diego. Gregory Bull / AP\\n\\nAccording to two of the former officials, career experts at the CDC\\'s Division of Global Migration and Quarantine — which would have jurisdiction over border measures to contain the virus — refused to be involved in the expulsions order. Instead, these former officials said, the order was drafted by Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) lawyer Brian Stimson, a political appointee. An HHS spokesperson said \"career and political attorneys\" who serve as lawyers for the CDC were involved because the order was a \"public health and legal matter.\"\\n\\nAfter mounting White House pressure, including a call from Vice President Mike Pence, CDC Director Robert Redfield signed the directive, which took effect on March 20. Katie Miller, a spokeswoman for Pence who is married to Miller, denied that the vice president \"directed the CDC on this issue.\"\\n\\n\"It was one of many tough choices that we were forced to make, and ultimately the White House and their preference prevailed,\" a second former public health official told CBS News. \"Public health authority had never been used in this way. A lot of folks, myself included, felt that this was a misappropriation of that authority.\"\\n\\nCDC officials initially were able to \"pare down\" the order so that it would have to be reauthorized every 30 days. In May, after two renewals, the order was extended indefinitely. A subsequent order issued last month will be in place until the CDC director determines \"the danger of further introduction of COVID-19 into the United States has ceased to be a serious danger.\"\\n\\n\"I guarantee you, under this administration, it will never happen,\" one of the former public health officials said. \"It will take a new administration, a new director to come in and say, \\'This is BS, I\\'m pulling it.\\'\"\\n\\nFor the first time, Joe Biden\\'s campaign on Sunday said the former vice president would order a review of the policy if elected. \"A Biden Administration would direct the CDC and DHS to review this policy and make the appropriate changes to ensure that people have the ability to submit their asylum claims while ensuring that we are taking the appropriate COVID-19 safety precautions, as guided by the science and public health experts,\" campaign spokesperson Pili Tobar told CBS News.\\n\\nThe Associated Press and The Wall Street Journal have also reported on the White House\\'s campaign to overrule CDC officials who opposed the border expulsions order.\\n\\nOn March 27, seven days after the CDC order took effect, Chad Mizelle, the top lawyer at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), sent a memo to Ken Cuccinelli, the second-in-command at the department, proposing to further restrict asylum eligibility based on the pandemic, according to documents obtained by the group Human Rights First under the Freedom of Information Act.\\n\\nIn a statement provided by the White House, Redfield said \"data pointed to a public health risk from COVID-19 to the illegal immigrants and the CPB employees at the border\" when the expulsions policy was being discussed. \"I determined it was in the public health interest, at that time, to issue the order and it was a decision I made as CDC Director,\" Redfield added. \"CDC continues to evaluate the situation on the border and our future decisions will also be led by the science and data at the border locations.\"\\n\\nA White House spokesman said the policy has \"saved countless American lives by protecting border states, including Texas and Arizona, from having their hospitals overwhelmed and border patrol agents from infection.\" Customs and Border Protection (CBP) also defended it.\\n\\n\"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention determined that the introduction and spread of COVID-19 in CBP stations and temporary holding facilities presents a danger to illegal border crossers, our frontline agents and officers, doctors and nurses, and the American public,\" the agency said in a statement to CBS News. \"It would take just a small number of individuals with COVID-19 to infect a large number of detainees and CBP personnel and potentially overwhelm local healthcare systems along the border.\"\\n\\nAsked during an interview with CBS News in September why U.S. immigration officials couldn\\'t exclude unaccompanied children from the expulsions policy, Cuccinelli said, \"You don\\'t gain the benefit of a public health order by filling it with exceptions.\"\\n\\n\"The rules are clear. The circumstances are extraordinary due to COVID, even in addition to the fact that people are traveling illegally,\" Cuccinelli said. \"I don\\'t know why anyone would expect anything other than quick removal from this country when they cross knowingly, illegally, no matter what their age.\"\\n\\n\"Patently unlawful\"\\n\\nChildren who set foot on U.S. soil without authorization have long been afforded additional legal protections.\\n\\nIn 2008, President George W. Bush signed the bipartisan Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act, which requires all government agencies to quickly transfer non-Mexican unaccompanied migrant children to the Office of Refugee Resettlement and its network of shelters. Under that law, Mexican children can be transferred to Mexican authorities after being screened to ensure they are not victims of trafficking or persecution.\\n\\nIn this Feb. 8, 2019 file photo, Salvadoran teen migrant Xiomara Henriquez Ayala peers over to the U.S. border fence from Tijuana, Mexico, looking for a way to help her companions cross undetected. Emilio Espejel / AP\\n\\nWhile in the custody of the refugee agency, which is a division of HHS, children are connected with lawyers and in certain cases, with child advocates. Unlike adults, they are protected from expedited deportations and can have their asylum requests adjudicated by officers trained to hear humanitarian protection claims, rather than before an immigration judge in an adversarial courtroom setting.\\n\\nIn addition to asylum, which is a humanitarian protection against persecution, migrant children can also be eligible to legalize their status in the U.S. through visas for neglected, abused or abandoned minors.\\n\\nWhile migrant children face deportation proceedings, the government is mandated to continuously pursue their release from custody by placing them with sponsors, who are typically family members residing in the U.S. These protections are established in U.S. law and the landmark Flores court settlement.\\n\\nThe Trump administration has denounced this patchwork of legal safeguards, arguing the protections encourage children from poor and often violence-plagued areas of Central America to journey north with the help of smugglers. Through different policies, the administration has sought to dismantle it.\\n\\nBut officials had never suspended these protections — until now. Citing the pandemic, the Trump administration has argued that migrant children are not entitled to these safeguards, and that the laws that created them are effectively inoperative as long as the CDC\\'s orders remain in place.\\n\\nThe administration has even stopped using the legal term \"unaccompanied alien children\" for underage migrants apprehended by border authorities without their parents and placed in expulsion proceedings. Officials have been calling them \"single minors,\" a change designed to reduce \"litigation liability risk,\" according to the CBP documents obtained by Human Rights First.\\n\\nTwo federal judges have questioned the legality of the expulsion policy, saying the government should be harmonizing public health laws with the legal safeguards Congress created for migrant children.\\n\\n\"The Trump administration\\'s use of the public health laws to summarily expel children without hearings is patently unlawful, as the two judges who have looked at the issue have concluded,\" Lee Gelernt, the American Civil Liberties Union attorney challenging the expulsions edict in court, told CBS News.\\n\\nCiting the CDC order, U.S. authorities have pushed 6,500 unaccompanied children back into Mexico. Hundreds of unaccompanied children and families were also held in border hotels by U.S. officials seeking to expel them via deportation flights until a federal judge banned the practice in September, citing in part the limited access to lawyers.\\n\\nIn recent weeks, border authorities have allowed more unaccompanied children to stay in the U.S. The Office of Refugee Resettlement took in 1,218 migrant minors in September, compared to the 39 it received in May. Its in-custody population has increased to nearly 2,000, after plummeting to 800 in the summer.\\n\\nAttorneys believe the increased referrals to the U.S. refugee agency stem from their efforts to stop the expulsions of the children they are able to locate, as well as the court-mandated ban on hotel detention, which hinders DHS\\' ability to house minors waiting to be placed on deportation flights.\\n\\nThe U.S., however, continues to expel unaccompanied children. In October, Guatemala, the largest source of non-Mexican migration to the U.S. southern border, reported receiving 407 unaccompanied and underage deportees, compared to 230 in September and 254 in August. And apprehensions of unaccompanied minors at the U.S.-Mexico border have increased steadily since the spring, reaching nearly 4,000 in September.\\n\\nAdvocates fear the U.S. government will continue citing public health laws to expel them.\\n\\n\"The policies that the administration has adopted, which are supposedly meant to address COVID-19, are based on totally spurious justifications,\" Kennji Kizuka, a senior researcher at Human Rights First, told CBS News. \"They have nothing to do with protecting public health and everything to do with blocking asylum-seekers and unaccompanied children from getting the protections that Congress created for them.\"\\n\\n\"We have no safety here\"\\n\\nAfter being turned back by U.S. border officials, Noeli, Valeria and Josue, the expelled Salvadoran siblings, were shuffled around Mexico by immigration authorities there, ultimately ending up in a government holding facility in the southern state of Veracruz.\\n\\nEvelin, their mother in Maryland, said she frantically made all the calls she could and eventually reached a Salvadoran consular official in Veracruz who helped facilitate the release of her children. She had her daughters go back to the U.S. border, saying they were not going to be safe in El Salvador, where they don\\'t have immediate family members to care for them. Evelin said her adult son, Josue, did not cross with them out of fear that it would lead to the siblings being expelled to Mexico again.\\n\\nIn a 2 a.m. phone call, Evelin said U.S. officials told her that her daughters were going to be expelled yet again — this time to El Salvador. But with the help of the Young Center for Immigrant Children\\'s Rights and other U.S.-based advocates, the girls were instead transferred to the U.S. refugee agency. They spent a month in two Texas shelters before being released to Evelin on September 24.\\n\\n\"I was very emotional to see them again,\" Evelin told CBS News in Spanish. \"That has been my fight, to see them again and to make sure nothing happened to them in El Salvador. I\\'m happy to have them here. They suffered a lot. How did they send them like that to Mexico? They suffered a lot there, during the trip, facing hunger.\"\\n\\nDespite their experiences in Mexico, Evelin\\'s girls are some of the lucky few. They are the migrant children found by an \"underground railroad\" network of immigration lawyers, human rights activists and child advocates who support humanitarian-centered border policies.\\n\\n\"Migrant children facing expulsion stand no chance of being allowed to stay in the U.S. without legal representation,\" Taylor Levy, an immigration attorney in El Paso, told CBS News. \"I worked on the case of a teenage boy fleeing death threats following the murder of his live-in uncle; he was expelled mere hours before we reached out to the government after becoming aware of his case, without ever having the chance to seek asylum.\"\\n\\nGabriela, the 13-year-old girl expelled to El Salvador, is hiding from gangs, according to lawyers with the Texas Civil Rights Project who are in communication with her New York-based mother. The Texas non-profit filed a lawsuit in federal court in June to try to secure Gabriela\\'s return to the U.S. but the case has stalled.\\n\\nGustavo, 12, poses for a photo with his father, Juan. The 12-year-old boy was expelled from the U.S. southern border in August.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Gustavo, the 12-year-old disabled boy, is back in Petén, one of the most poverty-stricken parts of Guatemala where local authorities are often unable or unwilling to stop violent crime.\\n\\nGustavo\\'s parents were never notified by U.S. officials of their son\\'s expulsion. They said they located him through a Facebook post and help from the Los Angeles-based Immigrant Defenders Law Center. \"He didn\\'t deserve this,\" Juan, Gustavo\\'s father, told CBS News in Spanish.\\n\\nJuan, a farmer, said he does not know how he will escape the vicious cycle of poverty that traps many poor Guatemalans. Now that Gustavo is back, Juan said he also fears for his son\\'s safety, citing recent roadside killings of two family members.\\n\\n\"We have no safety here. The authorities don\\'t do anything in our country,\" Juan said. \"They kill over anything here. That\\'s why we look for a safer country.\"\\n\\nHundreds of miles away, Elida cried when recounting her decision to let Gustavo cross the U.S. border while she remained in Ciudad Juárez, where she said he was almost kidnapped. She is waiting for her U.S. asylum hearing, which has been postponed indefinitely due to the pandemic.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know what I\\'m going to do,\" Elida said while sobbing. \"I don\\'t want to be here without my son.\"',\n",

       "  'text': 'Prince William contracted coronavirus earlier this year, BBC News reports. Palace sources told BBC News, a CBS News partner, about the royal\\'s positive coronavirus test, although the prince\\'s office has not commented publicly. It is believed William tested positive for the virus in April, according to BBC News.\\n\\nWilliam, also known as the Duke of Cambridge, is second in line to the throne after his father, Prince Charles. The Sun newspaper reports that William was treated by palace doctors and isolated at home, and that he was struggling to breathe at one point.\\n\\nHis condition may have been kept private because the royals didn\\'t want to alarm the nation, according to BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond. \"But the palace also tries to preserve some privacy for the Royal Family,\" Dymond said.\\n\\nGet Breaking News Delivered to Your Inbox\\n\\nPrince William remained active during April, attending 14 telephone and video call engagements, according to the BBC.\\n\\nHis father, Prince Charles, also tested positive for coronavirus in the spring. The prince\\'s Clarence House office released a statement in March saying Charles was showing \"mild symptoms but otherwise remains in good health and has been working from home throughout the last few days as usual.\"\\n\\nHis wife Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, tested negative for the virus, the spokesman said. The couple self-isolated at their home in Scotland.\\n\\n\"It is not possible to ascertain from whom the Prince caught the virus owing to the high number of engagements he carried out in his public role during recent weeks,\" the statement said.\\n\\nIn addition to the royals, Prime Minister Boris Johnson also battled the virus in the spring. Johnson became the first world leader to announce he had contracted COVID-19 in March. He was admitted to the hospital, then transferred to the ICU in April, but is now recovered.\\n\\nThe U.K. has recorded over 1,038,000 coronavirus cases and 46,800 deaths, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.',\n",

Farage was fired from hosting a talk radio program in Britain this June after comparing Black Lives Matter to the Taliban, and has most recently been seen campaigning alongside President Donald Trump in the United States.\\n\\nGet Breaking News Delivered to Your Inbox\\n\\nThe U.K. is preparing to enter a new, month-long national coronavirus lockdown this week. On Sunday, Farage and Tice wrote that \"lockdowns don\\'t work\" and that the elderly and vulnerable should be protected while others should be allowed to, \"with good hygiene measures and a dose of common sense, get on with life.\"\\n\\nU.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson had been staunchly opposed to another national lockdown, resisting calls from his opposition and members of his own party for a short \"circuit breaker\" to stop the growing spread of COVID-19 in Britain. Johnson instead opted for a tiered, localized system of restrictions, in the hopes of protecting the economy.\\n\\nBut recent scientific projections showing that all NHS hospital beds, including excess capacity, would be full by December 4th if decisive action wasn\\'t taken immediately, forced Johnson to use what he had labeled the \"nuclear\" option and declare another, nationwide lockdown.\\n\\n\"Faced with these latest figures, there is no alternative but to take further action at a national level,\" Johnson said.\\n\\n\"If we fail to get coronavirus under control, it is the sheer weight of demand from COVID patients that would deprive others of the care they need. Cancer treatment, heart surgery, other life-saving procedures, all this could be put at risk if we do not get the virus under control,\" Johnson continued.\\n\\n\"We must have the courage to live with the virus, not hide in fear of it,\" Farage and Tice wrote, adding, \"We are showing the courage needed to take on consensus thinking and vested interests on COVID.\"',\n",
