       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON — Intelligence and cybersecurity officials say they see no sign that Russian hackers have tried to infiltrate the election infrastructure the way they did in 2016, when all 50 states were probed, and voter rolls in some states were accessed. Officials also say that when it comes to cyber defenses, this is the best protected election in history.\\n\\nBut those same officials acknowledge that there is no way to protect every state, county and precinct network from infiltration by hackers, and that the Russians or another foreign power could still decide to mount a cyber offensive to disrupt the election.\\n\\nExperts say this is unlikely, because it would mean crossing a red line that could provoke a serious reaction from the U.S. government. And they say it would be extremely difficult for hackers to actually change vote tallies.\\n\\nBut if an adversary decided to attack, here are the ways experts say the Russians (or even less likely, the Iranians or the Chinese) could use cyber techniques to cause an election nightmare:\\n\\nTurn out the lights\\n\\n“Imagine an infrastructure attack, maybe in some key precincts, or states, swing states for the election, where maybe power goes out, or maybe the 911 service goes out,” Frank Figliuzzi, the FBI’s former counterintelligence chief and an NBC News contributor, said. “Or you can\\'t use your credit card or pump gas. Just something that sows discord and confusion.”\\n\\nU.S. officials have long said the Russians have planted “cyber bombs” on American power grids and communications networks to be triggered at a later date if desired. Perhaps the most ruthless and effective way the Russians could disrupt the election would be to shut down the power or the cellphone service in a few critical areas, making it impossible to vote.\\n\\nThis is perhaps the most frightening scenario but also the least likely, because such an attack could be considered an act of war, and the U.S. might feel compelled to retaliate, not just with a cyberattack, but also a military response.\\n\\nThe moon rises near PG&E\\'s Oakland K substation in the hills of Oakland, Calif., on Oct. 9, 2019. Jane Tyska / MediaNews Group/The Mercury News via Getty Images file\\n\\nLock up election computers\\n\\nAs the recent spate of attacks on hospitals has shown, ransomware is a devastating method of cyberattack that is extremely hard to stop. All it takes is a computer user clicking on a malicious link, thereby opening a network to malware that encrypts all the data and turns computers into bricks, unless a ransom is paid to unlock it.\\n\\nThe ransomware attacks against U.S. hospitals are being carried out by a Russian-speaking Eastern European criminal group, experts say, but nothing prevents the Russian government from deploying a similar group — the Russian state often works with criminal hackers, U.S. officials say — to attack American elections.\\n\\nA recent ransomware attack against local government systems in Hall County, Georgia, has slowed the election department’s capacity to count absentee ballots, officials there have said.\\n\\nVoting machines themselves aren’t connected to the internet, but ransomware attacks against a county or precinct could shut down critical supporting networks that could make it difficult to conduct the election. In a swing state, the impact could be huge.\\n\\n“We\\'ve seen an increase in the use of ransomware by folks who maybe couldn\\'t write it themselves, but now it\\'s available out on the black market and they can buy it,” said Matt Drake, a former FBI election threats specialist now with defense contractor SAIC. “And it\\'s certainly concerning that if it were launched shortly before the elections. it could be difficult for some places to overcome that.”\\n\\nTamper with voter rolls\\n\\nOn primary day in 2016, some voters showed up to the polls in Riverside County, California, only to learn that their voter registration information had been changed online — their party affiliation had been switched — and they couldn’t vote in their preferred primary. Baffled voters insisted they hadn’t made the changes. The local district attorney concluded the voter rolls had been hacked.\\n\\nU.S. officials say the Russians had access to many voter registration databases in 2016 and if they had chosen to do so could have tampered on a large enough scale to seriously disrupt the election. They say they haven’t detected Russian hacks of voter rolls this cycle, but that doesn’t mean there haven’t been any or won’t be.\\n\\nA building that houses the Internet Research Agency, also known as the \"troll factory,\" in St. Petersburg, Russia in 2018. Dmitri Lovetsky / AP file\\n\\nImagine if the Russians or some other adversary deleted every third voter registration record in three Pennsylvania counties, and voters showed up, only to be turned away.\\n\\nBlock publication of vote results\\n\\nIn Knox County Tennessee, during a 2018 mayoral primary, officials say a distributed denial of service, or DDOS, attack, shut down a county website publishing election results. The county had to mail out the official tallies. The actual vote was not affected, but some members of the public weren’t able to see the results on election night.\\n\\nIn a presidential election, The Associated Press and other news organizations deploy reporters all over the country to eyeball official results and send them in, so it would be difficult for hackers to blind the country to most of the results. Large media companies have strategies to defend against DDOS attacks.\\n\\nBut reporters can’t be everywhere.

       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON — Intelligence and cybersecurity officials say they see no sign that Russian hackers have tried to infiltrate the election infrastructure the way they did in 2016, when all 50 states were probed, and voter rolls in some states were accessed. Officials also say that when it comes to cyber defenses, this is the best protected election in history.\\n\\nBut those same officials acknowledge that there is no way to protect every state, county and precinct network from infiltration by hackers, and that the Russians or another foreign power could still decide to mount a cyber offensive to disrupt the election.\\n\\nExperts say this is unlikely, because it would mean crossing a red line that could provoke a serious reaction from the U.S. government. And they say it would be extremely difficult for hackers to actually change vote tallies.\\n\\nBut if an adversary decided to attack, here are the ways experts say the Russians (or even less likely, the Iranians or the Chinese) could use cyber techniques to cause an election nightmare:\\n\\nTurn out the lights\\n\\n“Imagine an infrastructure attack, maybe in some key precincts, or states, swing states for the election, where maybe power goes out, or maybe the 911 service goes out,” Frank Figliuzzi, the FBI’s former counterintelligence chief and an NBC News contributor, said. “Or you can\\'t use your credit card or pump gas. Just something that sows discord and confusion.”\\n\\nU.S. officials have long said the Russians have planted “cyber bombs” on American power grids and communications networks to be triggered at a later date if desired. Perhaps the most ruthless and effective way the Russians could disrupt the election would be to shut down the power or the cellphone service in a few critical areas, making it impossible to vote.\\n\\nThis is perhaps the most frightening scenario but also the least likely, because such an attack could be considered an act of war, and the U.S. might feel compelled to retaliate, not just with a cyberattack, but also a military response.\\n\\nThe moon rises near PG&E\\'s Oakland K substation in the hills of Oakland, Calif., on Oct. 9, 2019. Jane Tyska / MediaNews Group/The Mercury News via Getty Images file\\n\\nLock up election computers\\n\\nAs the recent spate of attacks on hospitals has shown, ransomware is a devastating method of cyberattack that is extremely hard to stop. All it takes is a computer user clicking on a malicious link, thereby opening a network to malware that encrypts all the data and turns computers into bricks, unless a ransom is paid to unlock it.\\n\\nThe ransomware attacks against U.S. hospitals are being carried out by a Russian-speaking Eastern European criminal group, experts say, but nothing prevents the Russian government from deploying a similar group — the Russian state often works with criminal hackers, U.S. officials say — to attack American elections.\\n\\nA recent ransomware attack against local government systems in Hall County, Georgia, has slowed the election department’s capacity to count absentee ballots, officials there have said.\\n\\nVoting machines themselves aren’t connected to the internet, but ransomware attacks against a county or precinct could shut down critical supporting networks that could make it difficult to conduct the election. In a swing state, the impact could be huge.\\n\\n“We\\'ve seen an increase in the use of ransomware by folks who maybe couldn\\'t write it themselves, but now it\\'s available out on the black market and they can buy it,” said Matt Drake, a former FBI election threats specialist now with defense contractor SAIC. “And it\\'s certainly concerning that if it were launched shortly before the elections. it could be difficult for some places to overcome that.”\\n\\nTamper with voter rolls\\n\\nOn primary day in 2016, some voters showed up to the polls in Riverside County, California, only to learn that their voter registration information had been changed online — their party affiliation had been switched — and they couldn’t vote in their preferred primary. Baffled voters insisted they hadn’t made the changes. The local district attorney concluded the voter rolls had been hacked.\\n\\nU.S. officials say the Russians had access to many voter registration databases in 2016 and if they had chosen to do so could have tampered on a large enough scale to seriously disrupt the election. They say they haven’t detected Russian hacks of voter rolls this cycle, but that doesn’t mean there haven’t been any or won’t be.\\n\\nA building that houses the Internet Research Agency, also known as the \"troll factory,\" in St. Petersburg, Russia in 2018. Dmitri Lovetsky / AP file\\n\\nImagine if the Russians or some other adversary deleted every third voter registration record in three Pennsylvania counties, and voters showed up, only to be turned away.\\n\\nBlock publication of vote results\\n\\nIn Knox County Tennessee, during a 2018 mayoral primary, officials say a distributed denial of service, or DDOS, attack, shut down a county website publishing election results. The county had to mail out the official tallies. The actual vote was not affected, but some members of the public weren’t able to see the results on election night.\\n\\nIn a presidential election, The Associated Press and other news organizations deploy reporters all over the country to eyeball official results and send them in, so it would be difficult for hackers to blind the country to most of the results. Large media companies have strategies to defend against DDOS attacks.\\n\\nBut reporters can’t be everywhere. If these attacks, which are easy to carry out, were deployed against local governments on a large scale around the country, experts say, they could disrupt and delay the dissemination of some election results and undermine confidence in the vote.\\n\\nPerception hack\\n\\nThe most plausible threat from Russia and other adversaries this election season is not a physical hack, but a mental one, experts say.

Security Council defeated a Russian resolution Friday to commemorate the 20th anniversary of a U.N. measure demanding equal participation for women in activities promoting global peace, with opponents objecting to its failure to adequately address human rights and the key role of civil society in pushing for gender equality.\\n\\nThe email vote on the resolution was 5-0, with 10 countries abstaining, far less than the minimum nine “yes” votes required for adoption.\\n\\nThe Russian draft was supported by Russia, China, Vietnam, Indonesia and South Africa. The countries that abstained were the United States, United Kingdom, France, Belgium, Dominican Republic, Germany, Estonia, Niger, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Tunisia.\\n\\nOpponents said the Russian draft weakened the initial U.N. resolution adopted in 2000 and nine follow-up resolutions — which Russia strongly denied.\\n\\nGermany’s U.N. Ambassador Christoph Heusgen said his calls for strong language on the human rights foundation of all the resolutions, and for “the adequate reflection of the critical role of civil society, women peacebuilders and human rights defenders” in implementing the measures were not reflected in the Russian draft.\\n\\nWhat is needed is “action and implementation,” he said, “not more words.”\\n\\nU.S. Ambassador Kelly Craft said the Trump administration and the other countries that abstained were protecting the women, peace and security agenda from an attack by Russia and China, which contributed to the draft resolution.\\n\\nShe said the draft resolution “was designed to undermine and reverse the progress of the past 20 years,” and “it is evident that our Russian and Chinese colleagues … do not believe women should be fully empowered to prevent conflict, or sit at the table to pursue peace and reconciliation.”\\n\\nRussia’s U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia, the current Security Council president, told a news conference after announcing the vote that the defeated draft did reaffirm and urge implementation of all 10 previous resolutions - and he dismissed claims that it was a step back or watered down as “not true.”\\n\\n“Civil society, human rights were all there,” he said. “We are for the civil society and human rights. To accuse us that we are trying to strike out the references to this is at best unworthy.”\\n\\nCivil society and human rights are mentioned in the defeated resolution’s introductory paragraphs — but not in its binding operative paragraphs. They were in the operative paragraphs in earlier drafts, but diplomats said the were dropped at China’s insistence.\\n\\nChina’s U.N. Mission accused countries that abstained of not being open to “new perspective and elements” focusing on the development of women and “clinging only to existing language and refusing improvement.”\\n\\nIt said in a statement after the vote that development and “empowerment of women are key for preventing conflict, sustaining peace and strengthening women’s protection and participation,” and if some unnamed council members had shown a “spirit of unity, constructiveness and flexibility,” a consensus could have been reached.\\n\\nThe Russian resolution would have commemorated the 20th anniversary of the initial women, peace and security resolution and noted “with deep concern persistent barriers” to its implementation.\\n\\nAt a council meeting Thursday commemorating the anniversary, the head of the U.N. agency promoting gender equality said the resolution’s demand for equal participation for women in peace negotiations has failed.\\n\\nWomen still remain “systematically excluded” from talks to end conflicts where men make decisions affecting their lives, UN Women’s Executive Director Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka said.\\n\\nDespite some good initiatives, she said that in peace negotiations from 1992 to 2019 only 13 percent of negotiators, 6 percent of mediators, and 6 percent of signatories to peace agreements were women.\\n\\nMlambo-Ngcuka said negotiations elevated and empowered “the actors that have fueled the violence,” instead of empowering women and others who are peace-builders - and women were either confined to “informal processes or relegated to the role of spectators.”\\n\\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres reiterated to the council that “gender equality is first and foremost a question of power, and wherever we look, power structures are dominated by men,” starting at the top where women lead only 7 percent of countries.\\n\\nBritain’s acting U.N. ambassador Jonathan Allen said after the vote that the UK held the widely shared view that the Russian draft lacked “sufficient language on implementation” and on women’s human rights and the protection of civil society.\\n\\n“The adoption of this text would have undermined the significant achievements made on this critical agenda and the enduring efforts of so many women’s rights activists,” Allen said.\\n\\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\\n\\nCopyright © 2020 The Washington Times, LLC.',\n",

RT said the interview was done from the White House property.\\n\\nDubious claims\\n\\nIn the 27-minute interview on Saturday, Atlas made a series of dubious claims. For example, Atlas misrepresented the effectiveness of masks, suggested that lockdowns kill people and discouraged testing of asymptomatic people. He also dismissed forecasts from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington School of Medicine that forecasts 399,000 coronavirus deaths in the US by February 1 under current conditions.\\n\\n\"The IHME model is really sort -- it\\'s absurd to start looking at this model at this point,\" Atlas said. \"At this point in time anybody who\\'s even focusing on models has not learned from the past.\"\\n\\nIn July, the IHME model predicted 208,255 Americans would have died from coronavirus by Nov. 1.

The tweet said, \"Masks work? NO\" followed by a series of falsehoods about the science behind the effectiveness of masks in combating the pandemic\\n\\nHe also encouraged officials to limit Covid-19 testing mainly to people experiencing symptoms . And on August 31, Atlas and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis urged public health officials in several Florida cities to focus less on universal testing and more on opening the economy and schools.\\n\\nTrump has relied on Atlas for advice on handling the coronavirus.

       "  'text': 'The threat of foreign interference in this campaign season has voters on edge. For some perspective on what\\'s happening and what\\'s at stake, \"CBS Evening News\" anchor Norah O\\'Donnell recently spoke to Dan Coats, a former Republican senator from Indiana who was President Trump\\'s first Director of National Intelligence. In his first television interview since the president abruptly replaced him last July, Coats said, like many Americans, he\\'s worried about what could happen on Election Day.\\n\\nDan Coats: The nightmare scenario is that on election night, people will draw conclusions or days after will draw conclusions that their candidate has been denied a victory and that public riots will result and violence might result from that.\\n\\nNorah O\\'Donnell: The president says, the only way he\\'s gonna lose is if the election is rigged. He also keeps saying, \"This will be the most corrupt election in American history.\" Is this going to be a corrupt election?\\n\\nCoats: The president says things. He counter says them sometimes the next day. But I think if we adhere to the principles that are necessary for a legitimate election, and the American people understand that and demand that, I think that\\'s where we\\'ll end up.\\n\\nO\\'Donnell: Have you seen any evidence of widespread fraud? Or anything that leads you to believe this will not be a fair election?\\n\\nCoats: No, I haven\\'t and the people I have talked to who are looking at this have basically said they have not seen this, at least at this point.\\n\\nWhat the intelligence community has seen are efforts by China, Iran and other nations to disrupt Tuesday\\'s election. But the country that concerns Coats the most is Russia, in what he\\'s calling the Super Bowl of elections.\\n\\nCoats: They\\'re the New England Patriots of messing with elections. I think they do it better than anybody else.\\n\\nEXCLUSIVE: Pres. Trump’s former intel chief Dan Coats calls the 2020 elections the “Super Bowl” of all elections in terms of foreign interference. “We really have to understand that not only the Russians, but other nations would be going after us,” Coats tells @NorahODonnell. pic.twitter.com/iJ7WAqtBEL — CBS Evening News (@CBSEveningNews) October 29, 2020\\n\\nO\\'Donnell: President Trump has continuously referred to Russian interference in our elections as a hoax. Are they a hoax?\\n\\nCoats: I am absolutely clear that by the intelligence we have gathered that we have full confidence that the Russians are going after our elections. They\\'re trying to undermine our confidence in Democracy. They\\'re doing it now. They\\'re gonna continue to do it, and the American people need to know that.\\n\\nO\\'Donnell: The president\\'s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, has openly admitted to seeking information that could damage the Bidens. And one of his sources is someone who the U.S. government has said is an \"active Russian agent.\" Isn\\'t that a national security threat?\\n\\nCoats: We need to get to the bottom of that, absolutely.\\n\\nFormer Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats says that he has complete confidence in the 2017 intelligence community assessment on Russian meddling in the 2016 election that claimed the Russian government “developed a clear preference” for Trump. https://t.co/1bwr6TYDtp pic.twitter.com/UA6dxzDk0W — CBS Evening News (@CBSEveningNews) October 29, 2020\\n\\nO\\'Donnell: What\\'s your advice to the average voter, Democrat or Republican who\\'s anxious, nervous about this election?\\n\\nCoats: Let\\'s stand up together and say, \"I\\'m a Republican, I\\'m a Democrat, we\\'re gonna stand together and at least do this.\" If we don\\'t, Joe Biden and Donald Trump will not be the winners. Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping and the Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, they\\'ll be laughing and saying, \"We got \\'em.\" We cannot let that happen.',\n",

The town is named Borshchiv, which means “belonging to borscht.” It is just one of a dozen cities and villages in Ukraine named for borscht.\\n\\nGiven this clear commitment to borscht, Ukrainians wonder why the soup is commonly assumed to be Russian, a national dish of their arch enemy.\\n\\nNow a Ukrainian chef supported by the Ministry of Culture and Parliament is trying to set the record straight with an application to the United Nation’s cultural body, UNESCO, to list borscht as an intangible part of Ukraine’s cultural heritage.',\n",
