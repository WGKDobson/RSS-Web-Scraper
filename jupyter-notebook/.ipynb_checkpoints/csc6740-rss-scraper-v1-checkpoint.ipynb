       "  'text': 'People react as media announce that Democratic U.S. presidential nominee Joe Biden has won the 2020 U.S. presidential election, in Los Angeles, California, U.S., November 7, 2020. Patrick T. Fallon | Reuters\\n\\nIt is now likely that former Vice President Joe Biden will become the 46th president of the United States. He\\'ll do so with the largest number of votes ever cast for any American presidential candidate in history after an electoral-turnout rate that was the highest since 1900. Though it may not feel that way right now, that outcome would mark a triumph of historic significance for the country\\'s democratic process and institutions. It would be one that would come despite President Donald Trump\\'s incendiary, unsubstantiated charges on Thursday of electoral fraud and despite a host of legal challenges that will now play out but be unlikely to change the outcome. Though one would hope the Republican chorus against Trump\\'s disruptive efforts would be louder, significant voices are joining. Republican Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, whose state is a key battleground, called the president\\'s charges \"disturbing to me because he made very, very serious allegations without any evidence to support it.\" Rep. Adam Kinzinger, a Republican from Illinois, tweeted, \"STOP Spreading debunked misinformation.\" Biden and his team recognize that history compels them, once elected, to emerge as more than just the victor. America\\'s internal divisions and a rising tide of international challenges will require the kind of unifying leader that America has had before at such times of dangerous division. The challenges may seem daunting, but they were also daunting when Gerald Ford stepped in after the resignation of Richard Nixon. And the current rifts in the United States are nowhere near as bitter as what faced President Ulysses S. Grant after the Civil War in 1869, when he succeeded Andrew Johnson, the first U.S. president to be impeached. Johnson refused to attend Grant\\'s inauguration, and Grant refused to ride in the same carriage as Johnson. Yet President Grant brought together a divided country and healed the post-war economy, and his new Department of Justice prosecuted the Ku Klux Klan.\\n\\nObstacle and opportunity\\n\\nVice President Biden has been consistent as a candidate that he wishes to play a unifying role as the president for all Americans -- and alongside the country\\'s traditional allies. It will not be easy, but it is doable. The Republican gains in the House of Representatives and the party\\'s likely continued hold on the Senate majority would present both an obstacle and an opportunity for a Democratic president. In the first days of his administration, Biden could strike deals across the aisle to take on the potentially unifying perils of COVID-19 and the economic downturn through more productive stimulus spending and infrastructure investment. With Kamala Harris as the first Black woman to serve as the nation\\'s vice president, a Biden administration would be well-positioned to support an inclusive, new civil-rights movement. It\\'s also far beyond time for the United States to rally its democratic partners around the world in common cause to tackle the rising, systemic, authoritarian challenge posed by China and others – an issue against which US political differences pale in importance. Perhaps a Trump concession to Biden will yet come, which would help the healing. For now, that is difficult to imagine. Under no conditions could one expect anything approaching the power of Senator John McCain\\'s concession to Barack Obama in 2008. McCain\\'s speech went viral this week across the country, underscoring the national yearning for that brand of elegance. \"In a contest as long and difficult as this campaign has been,\" said McCain then, Obama\\'s \"success alone commands my respect for his ability and perseverance. But that he managed to do so by inspiring the hopes of so many millions of Americans, who had once wrongly believed that they had little at stake or little influence in the election of an American president, is something I deeply admire and commend him for achieving. This is a historic election, and I recognize the special significance it has for African Americans and for the special pride that must be theirs tonight.\"\\n\\nMargin of victory'},\n",

This shows that women can do anything! We are one step closer to the presidency.\"\\n\\nNicole McClean, Illinois\\n\\n\"I am an immigrant. I am a Black woman. I am a mother to a USA female sailor. I am a small business owner. I have preexisting conditions. I can breathe again. Thank God. Bless Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.\"\\n\\nBradley Beaird\\n\\n\"I just hope he will do what he says he will do and NOT ban fracking and stop drilling because there are many men that are struggling out there to provide for their families!!!!

No more porn-stars, no more corruption, no more military bashing, no more tax evasion!\"\\n\\nStephanie Little, Bismarck, North Dakota\\n\\n\"This is a beautiful moment in American history. I can\\'t stop crying. After four years of a President that broke me (and others) down mentally, over and over again, this makes me proud to be an American again.\"\\n\\nRicardo Romeu\\n\\n\"I feel like America is about to be rudely awakened. This \\'President-elect\\' and his running mate are too liberal for this country and do not truly understand what Freedom costs. I, like many others, will say it again Joe Biden is a FAILED career politician. 47 years with nothing but empty promises and a silent 8 years as Vice President under the Obama administration. So though CNN and the mainstream media AKA the MOB says that Joe Biden has (won), I believe it is still purely speculation and the truth of this election will come to light. #TRUMP4EVER\"\\n\\nAlison, Massachusetts\\n\\n\"I am feeling such incredible relief and renewed hope. The toxicity of the Trump presidency has been surreal, like watching a horror movie unfold, thinking it can\\'t get any worse until it does. Now, we can come out of the dark scary basement and into the light to celebrate this historic moment. I am beyond thrilled that not only do we have our first female VP, but that she is a woman of color. My greatest hope is that we can heal as a country and move beyond the divided nation we have become so that we can truly be the United States again. It is going to be a hard road but I have faith we can get there someday. Cheers to Biden/Harris, lead the way!\"\\n\\nChris Dawson. Los Angeles, California\\n\\n\"THE MOST AWESOME NEWS THIS YEAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\"\\n\\nLiam, Austin, Texas\\n\\n\"There is a future for me as a gay man in America.\"\\n\\nAlisha, Norfolk, Virginia\\n\\n\"Literally in tears as I read the results and the magnitude of this moment is sinking in. I know everything will not be unraveled immediately, shoot, not even within the first two years, but it\\'s a chance at a fresh start. America needs a re-set! It\\'s important how you treat and talk to people -- Pennsylvania, Arizona, Illinois and Georgia reflect that. Grateful and hopeful is how I am feeling right! Grateful and Hopeful.\"\\n\\nTina, Missouri\\n\\n\"I trusted our economy with Trump. I\\'m nervous with Biden.\"\\n\\nDr. Marissa Ferrazzo-Weller, Clifton, New Jersey\\n\\n\"I am ecstatic and relieved. I hope for more unity as a nation and a very concerted push for further racial equity as well as more focused pandemic response.\"\\n\\nVeronica Boller, Lexington, Kentucky\\n\\n\"I feel relieved, like a huge weight has been lifted from my shoulders. I feel grateful to know that the majority of this country feels as though character matters. I feel proud that our democracy came through and we let every voice have a chance in this election. I am not feeling afraid of Donald Trump and what he has done or will do to negatively impact our country like I have felt for a long time. I am hopeful his cabinet, campaign members, voters, and supporters will pay attention to facts. And lessen the amount of power Trump feels from people believing his blatant lies. And I\\'m feeling sorry that my state allows Mitch McConnell to continue his overdue time in the US Senate.\"\\n\\nRK, Ohio\\n\\n\"Sad day in America that Joe Biden might be president!\"\\n\\nBecky Makool, Anchorage, Alaska\\n\\n\"I just learned 10 minutes ago that the nightmare of Trump is finally and truly over! Hallelujah!! The tremendous hope in my heart for this outcome and a positive new start for our country has turned to joy at the news! Unity, equality, peace, and environmental protection are on their way back to the US.\"\\n\\nMary Kelly English, St. Paul, Minnesota\\n\\n\"Ecstatic!!!!! A voice of reason, experience and true leadership will replace a narcistic, malignant, racist, misogynist, impetuous, undisciplined, corrupt and absolute immoral person who has tarnished our reputation in the world. Praise the Lord!!!! So glad to be rid of him and his corrupt family who only care about enriching themselves.\"\\n\\nWarren Alderton, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\\n\\n\"I\\'m a Pennsylvania native. I am sitting here in my home, weeping with relief and happiness. At last, something good in 2020.\"\\n\\nLuis Garcia, Yakima, Washington\\n\\n\"Free at last, free at last!!! Thank GOD almighty we are Free At Last!!\"\\n\\nMary Holley, Florida\\n\\n\"Been a Republican woman voter all my adult life, college educated and nearing retirement age, I\\'m proud to voice that I voted for Biden/Harris, and with their win I can breathe again. Trump\\'s lies and the fact the Republican establishment didn\\'t, or wouldn\\'t, reign him in from his own narcissistic bullying ways, has cost the party my commitment. As of today I will be officially changing my party affiliation. I waited to make this change as a celebratory gesture for a Biden/Harris win. And now I am a proud Democrat and American!!! Congratulations President Biden and Vice President Harris :)\"\\n\\nAngie, Florida\\n\\n\"I have never felt so proud to be an American. As a health care worker here in Florida, Trump did nothing to prevent Covid from spreading. Now we have a fighting chance.\"\\n\\nLinda Gallagher, Allentown, Pennsylvania\\n\\n\"I\\'m still so emotional and have cried happy tears over & over. As a senior (66) woman from Pennsylvania, I\\'m so proud to have played a small part of history with Pennsylvania putting President-elect Biden over the top. Decency will replace drama. Compassion will replace corruption. I believe, as Joe Bide does, that we are all Americans regardless of party and must come together. I\\'m already praying for Joe & Kamala to lead us forward.\"\\n\\nSimon, Orange, New Jersey\\n\\n\"I am content with the election of Biden and Harris and pleased with the overall success of their campaign. However, as a African-American I am cautious of the numbers of people who support the same old hate. As they stated there\\'s a great deal of work to be done to heal the country and we want a seat at the table of change.\"\\n\\nJimmy, Louisiana\\n\\n\"I think it\\'s rigged and that Joe Biden will destroy our country. Nobody talked about the progress and the good things Trump did, only his personality flaws. Most unappreciated and accomplished president of all time.\"\\n\\nSilvia, California\\n\\n\"Sad day in America history. Never seen so much fraud in a election. The Media is the worst and never shared all the good that President Trump did for the America people. Trump clean up Obama /Biden mess for 8 suffering years. Now we can look forward to Biden selling out the USA, again. The whole country is going to look like the state of California. Where so many people have left California. Higher taxes for us who have work hard all our life and also I feel that freedom is going away.\"'},\n",

       "  'text': 'BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) - If Louisiana’s decision to reelect a Democratic governor last year made anyone forget about the state’s political bent, the latest presidential and congressional elections provided a definitive reminder that Louisiana remains strongly conservative and deeply red, particularly in federal races.\\n\\nPresident Donald Trump solidly won the state, Republican congressional incumbents easily won reelection, an anti-abortion amendment received overwhelming support and the only undecided U.S. House seat appears likely to be a runoff between two GOP contenders.\\n\\nSome Democrats looked to the 2019 reelection victory of John Bel Edwards, the Deep South’s only Democratic governor, as a harbinger of better chances Louisiana would embrace the party’s candidates for more statewide offices.\\n\\nBut Edwards‘ victory involved a special set of election circumstances and a political unicorn of a Democratic candidate for Louisiana. He’s a moderate, anti-abortion, pro-gun former Army ranger from a law enforcement family who faced weak Republican opponents in an off-year election.\\n\\nThe 2020 election cycle played to a more traditional storyline in Louisiana, where Republicans maintained their strength, incumbency remained powerful and partisan feelings for the presidential competition appeared to drive decisions down the ballot.\\n\\nTrump received 58% of the 2.1 million ballots cast in Louisiana, the same percentage he received four years earlier and a higher number of individual votes than in 2016.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Republican U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy easily bested a field of 14 opponents to win 59% of the vote and avoid a runoff election, despite Democratic efforts to push Shreveport Mayor Adrian Perkins for the job with high-profile endorsements and fundraising.\\n\\nAmong other Louisiana election takeaways:\\n\\n-State sentiment remains staunchly anti-abortion, as demonstrated by the overwhelming support for Amendment 1. More than 62% of voters agreed to rewrite the Louisiana Constitution to ensure it does not offer protections for abortion rights, a provision that would become relevant if the U.S. Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion nationwide is overturned.\\n\\n-Contested presidential races drive turnout. More than 69% of Louisiana’s registered voters cast ballots for the presidential competition, but the number of people who bothered making decisions in other races was lower. Sixty-seven percent voted in the U.S. Senate race, and the percentages dropped further for the seven constitutional amendments on the ballot statewide, according to turnout data from the Secretary of State’s office.\\n\\nThat means candidates forced into a Dec. 5 runoff election should likely expect a sizable drop in voter participation next month, when voters in northeast and central Louisiana will decide a U.S. House seat, New Orleans voters will pick a new district attorney and Baton Rouge voters will determine whether to keep their incumbent Democratic mayor or replace her with a Republican.\\n\\n-Louisiana voters are getting used to casting their ballots ahead of Election Day. Of Louisiana’s more than 2.1 million votes in last week’s election, the Secretary of State’s office said slightly more than half were cast on Election Day. Another 38% were cast during the 10-day in-person early voting period, and 8% were done through absentee ballot. Early voting shattered records this year.\\n\\n-Of three state House members running for other elected positions this fall, only one emerged victorious. Republican Rep. Stephen Dwight was elected Calcasieu Parish district attorney. His exit from the House will cause a reshuffling on one of the most important committees of this term, the House and Governmental Affairs Committee, which Dwight has chaired. That panel will take the lead in the House on the redrawing of political maps after the latest U.S. Census is released.\\n\\n-Voters have put to rest a yearslong dispute between Edwards and Treasurer John Schroder over Louisiana’s unclaimed property money. The governor and Republican treasurer struck the agreement, but voters needed to approve a constitutional amendment to wrap up the deal.\\n\\nThe amendment backed by 64% of voters will lock up the unclaimed property dollars in a trust fund, keeping lawmakers and the governor from spending the money owed to people on general government expenses, as they had done for decades. In exchange to backing the trust fund Schroder wanted, Edwards and lawmakers got to spend millions of the unclaimed property dollars earlier this year to piece together the budget one last time.\\n\\n___\\n\\nEDITOR’S NOTE: Melinda Deslatte has covered Louisiana politics for The Associated Press since 2000.

       "  'text': 'President Trump had a slightly bumpy relationship with Theresa May, the first British prime minister he had to deal with in his presidency.\\n\\nHe arrived for his first visit to the UK as president on 12 July 2018 but it was immediately overshadowed by the publication of an interview the US president gave to The Sun newspaper.\\n\\nIn it, he said the UK would \"probably not\" get a trade deal with the US if the prime minister\\'s Brexit plan went ahead.\\n\\n\"If they do a deal like that, we would be dealing with the European Union instead of dealing with the UK, so it will probably kill the deal,\" he told the paper, adding that Mrs May\\'s plan \"will definitely affect trade with the United States, unfortunately in a negative way.\"\\n\\nBut at a joint news conference on the second day of his visit, he changed his tone and said a trade deal \"will absolutely be possible\" after the UK leaves the EU. He also said Brexit was an \"incredible opportunity\".\\n\\nMr Trump also met the Queen, although there was no open carriage ride with her through the streets of the capital as the trip was designated a \"working visit\" rather than an official state visit.\\n\\nAsked about the protests that greeted his arrival in the UK, he insisted many people were \"delighted\" he was visiting, adding: \"I get thousands of notifications from people in the UK that they love the president of the United States.\"\\n\\nBut when he arrived in London for a state visit the following year, he was welcomed by further protests and a giant balloon depicting him as a baby.\\n\\nThis time around, the president was given the honour of a state banquet at Buckingham Palace with the Queen, during which he praised the \"eternal friendship\" between the UK and US.\\n\\nBut earlier in the day, he had called London Mayor Sadiq Khan - who had said the UK should \"not roll out the red carpet\" for Mr Trump - a \"stone cold loser\".\\n\\nA few weeks later, Mr Trump also laid into Mrs May and her proposed Brexit deal, tweeting: \"What a mess she and her representatives have created. I told her how it should be done, but she decided to go another way.\"\\n\\nSo it was little surprise when Mr Trump appeared excited to congratulate Boris Johnson on becoming the new prime minister in July 2019, saying: \"He will be great!\"\\n\\nWhen asked what advice he would give to Mr Johnson on Brexit, the president replied: \"He needs no advice. He\\'s the right man for the job. I\\'ve been saying that for a long time.\"\\n\\nWhile the pair have enjoyed warm personal relations, there have been some differences on policy, most notably on China, the Iran nuclear deal and the future of Nato.\\n\\nBut after this year, they now have another thing in common - they both got and recovered from coronavirus. When Mr Johnson left intensive care back in April, Mr Trump said it was \"great news\" and after he returned to the White House to recover from the virus in October, he thanked the British PM for \"his friendship and support\".'},\n",

       "  'text': 'US Election 2020: Can you only vote Trump or Biden and other questions Published duration 3 days ago Related Topics US election 2020\\n\\nAre Donald Trump and Joe Biden the only candidates for president? And why are the voting systems in Maine and Nebraska different to the rest of the United States?\\n\\nHere are some of your key questions around the US election answered.\\n\\nIf you vote for someone who is not a Democrat or Republican, what happens to your vote? Jan, Australia\\n\\nYour vote will still count. Because the focus of the 2020 US presidential election campaign is on just two men, Donald Trump and Joe Biden, it\\'s very easy to forget that there are many other candidates.\\n\\nAccording to the Federal Election Commission, a whopping 1,214 presidential hopefuls have filed papers for this election.\\n\\nThe vast majority of candidates, including the musician Kanye West, only stood in a few places.\\n\\nimage copyright Reuters image caption Kanye West at his first presidential rally\\n\\nHowever the Libertarian Party\\'s Jo Jorgensen was on the ballot for all 50 states and the District of Columbia.\\n\\nIn October, the BBC heard from three of these other presidential candidates.\\n\\nIn 1968, a third-party candidate, George Wallace, garnered nearly ten million votes, winning five states. In 1992, nearly 20 million people voted for Ross Perot, although he won no states.\\n\\nWhy do Maine and Nebraska split their electoral college votes? Elizabeth, London\\n\\nMaine and Nebraska are the only two US states where the candidate with most votes does not take all of its electoral college votes.\\n\\nInstead, they use what is called the \"congressional district method\". Each state\\'s electoral college vote is equal to its number of Senate seats - always two - plus its number of congressional districts.\\n\\nThe candidate with most votes in each congressional district takes one electoral college vote and then whoever wins the state-wide vote gains two more college votes.\\n\\nHaving briefly used the split-vote method in the 1820s, Maine reintroduced it in 1969. This was because of concerns that a candidate in a three-way presidential election, like that of 1968, could take all the state\\'s electoral college votes with little over a third of the popular vote.\\n\\nNebraska has used the split-vote system since 1996, according to one commentator, \"to attract presidential candidates to a state they usually ignore because it\\'s so reliably conservative.\"\\n\\nHow does the point system work with the presidential race? Robert Williams, Sacramento\\n\\nThe number of electoral college members - known as electors - from each state is roughly in line with the size of its population. Each state has as many electors as it has lawmakers in the US Congress (representatives in the House and senators).\\n\\nCalifornia has the most electors - 55 - while some states with smaller populations like Wyoming, Alaska and North Dakota (and Washington DC) have the minimum of three. There are 538 electors in total.\\n\\nEach elector represents one electoral vote, and a candidate needs to gain a majority of the votes - 270 or more - to win the presidency.\\n\\nWho are the members of the electoral college, how are they chosen and how long do they serve in the role? - Penny Reid, Northumberland, UK\\n\\nThe members of the electoral college are usually nominated by the Republican and Democratic parties for each election.\\n\\nThere are different rules for nominating them in each state, and they are officially selected on polling day.\\n\\nThe college members - known as electors - often have connections in the US political parties, like activists or former politicians.\\n\\nBill Clinton was a Democratic elector in 2016, and Donald Trump Junior was put forward by the Republicans.\\n\\nimage copyright Reuters image caption Bill Clinton was US president from 1993-2001\\n\\nCould Donald Trump try to contest the results of the election? - Basel, Israel\\n\\nYes. Both campaigns have said they\\'re already preparing for legal disputes following the election.\\n\\nThey have a right to demand a recount in most states, usually if the result there is tight.\\n\\nThere\\'s been a surge in postal voting this year, and it\\'s also possible that the validity of these ballots could be challenged in court.\\n\\nThese lawsuits could make their way up to the US Supreme Court - the ultimate legal authority in the US.\\n\\nThis happened in 2000, when the Supreme Court stopped a recount in Florida and ruled in favour of Republican George W Bush, who became president.\\n\\nWhat influence does the national vote have on the way the electoral college votes? - Caroline Bonwitt, Gloucestershire, UK\\n\\nUS presidents are not decided by the national popular vote, but by winning in enough states.\\n\\nThe winner in each state gets the support of a number of electors based roughly on its population.\\n\\nThese electors meet a few weeks after polling day - forming the electoral college - to vote to officially nominate the next president.\\n\\nTo win the White House, 270 electoral votes are needed.\\n\\nmedia caption The US president is not chosen directly by voters, but by what\\'s known as the electoral college\\n\\nPretty much everyone in the world is fed up with this \"electoral college\" nonsense. So how hard is it to just make US elections a majority vote and dump the college? - Judy, BC, Canada\\n\\nThe US electoral system is laid out in the constitution, so changing it would require a constitutional amendment.\\n\\nThis would have to be approved by two-thirds of both the Senate and the House of Representatives, or the same proportion of state legislatures. This would then need to be ratified by three-quarters of US states.\\n\\nThis is very unlikely to be successful, although there have been attempts to change the system in the past.\\n\\nThere is an ongoing effort by some states to award their electoral votes to the winner of the popular vote, no matter who wins there. This is a way off, but would effectively nullify the electoral college.\\n\\nWhat happens if it\\'s a tie? - Chinga, China\\n\\nThere are 538 electoral votes up for grabs, with a fixed number of electors representing each state based roughly on the size of its population.\\n\\nThis means a draw is possible at 269 votes each, although unlikely.\\n\\nIf no candidate gains a majority of votes in the electoral college, it would be up to the US Congress to decide.\\n\\nMembers of Congress elected in the 2020 elections would take on this responsibility.\\n\\nThe House of Representatives would vote to decide the president, with each state delegation having one vote - a majority of 26 is needed for a candidate to become president.\\n\\nThe Senate would select the vice-president, with all 100 senators having a vote.\\n\\nWho will decide the presidency if there is no definitive winner via the electoral college? -Robert Pallone, Maryland\\n\\nIf there\\'s no definite winner in the electoral college, it would mean there\\'s either been a tie in the overall result (covered above), or that ongoing legal challenges in disputed states have not been resolved, and so their electors cannot be chosen.\\n\\nThe electoral college - whose job it is to formally nominate the next president - meets on 14 December this year. Electors must be put forward by each state for their winning candidate by then.\\n\\nIf the election results are still disputed and certain states can\\'t decide which candidate to give their electors to, then it would be up to the US Congress to step in.\\n\\nThe US constitution imposes a final deadline - the term of the president (and vice-president) expires on 20 January at noon.\\n\\nIf Congress has been unable to choose the winner by then, there\\'s a line of succession set out in law.\\n\\nFirst in line is the Speaker of the House of Representatives, currently Nancy Pelosi, followed by the second highest ranking member of the Senate, currently Charles Grassley.\\n\\nThis has never happened before so it\\'s unclear how, under these exceptional circumstances, this would work in practice.\\n\\nWhat makes some states\\' votes count more than others? - S Robertson, Sussex, UK\\n\\nCandidates tend to campaign in states where the result is uncertain - that\\'s why people say the votes in these states \"count more\".\\n\\nThese places are known as battleground or swing states.\\n\\nThe US electoral system means that in all but two states, the margin of victory doesn\\'t matter, as whoever gets the most votes wins all the electoral votes on offer in that state.\\n\\nimage copyright Getty Images image caption People waiting to vote in California\\n\\nIn states which are almost guaranteed to vote a certain way - like California (Democrat) or Alabama (Republican) - candidates have less incentive to campaign.\\n\\nThey\\'ll put most effort into a handful of tight races, such as Florida and Pennsylvania, targeting voters that could go either way.\\n\\nIf postal votes that get counted several days after the election, change the final tally of a state from Trump to Biden or vice-versa, then what is the protocol for re-announcing a winner? - Charlie Etheridge, Kent, UK\\n\\nThere\\'s no legal requirement to announce a winner on election night - this is done as a projection by major US media outlets.\\n\\nThe full count is never completed on the night - but enough votes are usually in to confirm a winner.\\n\\nThese are unofficial results which are certified only weeks later, when confirmed by state officials.\\n\\nmedia caption Could postal voting upend the US election?\\n\\nThis year, the US media will likely be more cautious in calling a winner, as there are more postal votes and these take longer to count.\\n\\nThis could mean the leader on election night in some states could end up losing once all the votes - including postal ballots - are counted.\\n\\nYour Questions Answered: What questions do you have about the US election?\\n\\nHow does vote counting work?

       "  'text': \"Click or tap on an underlined word for a short definition or explanation\\n\\nThe US president has a huge influence on people's lives both at home and abroad, so when the next election is held on 3 November, the outcome will matter to everyone.\\n\\nThe US political system is dominated by just two parties, so the president always belongs to one of them.\\n\\nThe Republicans are the conservative political party in the US and their candidate in this year’s election is President Donald Trump, who is hoping to secure another four years in power.\\n\\nSkip Republicans The Republican Party is also known as the GOP, or the Grand Old Party. In recent years, it has stood for lower taxes, gun rights and tighter restrictions on immigration. Support for the party tends to be stronger in more rural parts of America. Former Republican presidents include George W Bush, Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon. End of Republicans\\n\\nThe Democrats are the liberal political party in the US and their candidate is Joe Biden, an experienced politician best-known for serving as Barack Obama’s vice president for eight years.\\n\\nSkip Democrats The Democratic Party is best defined by its liberal stances on issues like civil rights, immigration, and climate change. It believes government should play a bigger role in people’s lives, like providing health insurance. Support for the party tends to be stronger in urban parts of America. Former Democratic presidents include John F Kennedy and Barack Obama. End of Democrats\\n\\nBoth men are in their 70s - Mr Trump would be 74 years old at the start of his second term, while at 78, Mr Biden would be the oldest first-term president in history.\\n\\nHow is the winner decided?\\n\\nBoth candidates compete to win electoral college votes.\\n\\nSkip electoral college Like most voting systems, the electoral college has a number of pros and cons but it is widely respected because of its historical roots in the founding of the US. It usually reflects the popular vote, but it has failed to in two of the last five elections, including when Donald Trump won in 2016. End of electoral college\\n\\nEach state gets a certain number of electoral college votes partly based on its population and there are a total of 538 up for grabs, so the winner is the candidate that wins 270 or more.\\n\\nThis means voters decide state-level contests rather than the national one, which is why it’s possible for a candidate to win the most votes nationally - like Hillary Clinton did in 2016 - but still be defeated by the electoral college.\\n\\nSkip Hillary Clinton Hillary Clinton was Donald Trump’s opponent in 2016. She ended up winning nearly three million more votes than Mr Trump, mainly because she picked up a high number of votes in strong Democrat states like New York and California. However, her rival comfortably beat her in the electoral college race 304 to 227 because he won several tight contests in key states. End of Hillary Clinton\\n\\nAll but two states have a winner-takes-all rule, so whichever candidate wins the highest number of votes is awarded all of the state’s electoral college votes.\\n\\nMost states lean heavily towards one party or the other, so the focus is usually on a dozen or so states where either of them could win. These are known as the battleground states.\\n\\nSkip battleground states These states, which are often referred to as swing states as well, are where voters are split relatively evenly between Democrats and Republicans. Traditional battleground states include Florida and Ohio. Other states that have been strongly Republican in the past, like Arizona and Texas, are considered battlegrounds in 2020 due to increasing support for the Democratic Party. End of battleground states\\n\\nWho can vote and how do they do it?\\n\\nIf you’re a US citizen and you’re 18 or over, you should be eligible to vote in the presidential election, which takes place every four years.\\n\\nSkip eligible to vote In 2016, about 245 million people were eligible to vote, but fewer than 140 million people actually did. According to the US Census Bureau, the majority of people who didn’t register to vote said they just weren’t interested in politics. Those who registered but didn’t actually vote said they didn’t like the candidates. End of eligible to vote\\n\\nHowever, lots of states have passed laws requiring voters to show identification documents to prove who they are before they can vote.\\n\\nThese laws are often put into place by Republicans who say they’re needed to guard against voter fraud. But Democrats accuse them of using this as a form of voter suppression as it is often poorer, minority voters who are unable to provide ID like a driving licence.\\n\\nHow people vote is a contentious issue this year because of the coronavirus pandemic. Some politicians are calling for wider use of postal ballots, but President Trump has said - with very little evidence - that this could result in more voter fraud.\\n\\nSkip voter fraud Critics say postal ballots are susceptible to fraud - and there have been isolated incidents involving Republicans and Democrats - but numerous nationwide and state-level studies have found no evidence of any widespread fraud. End of voter fraud\\n\\nIs the election just about who is president?\\n\\nNo. All of the attention will be on Trump v Biden, but voters will also be choosing new members of Congress when they fill in their ballots.\\n\\nSkip Congress Congress is the part of the US government that writes and passes laws. It's made up of two chambers - the House of Representatives and the Senate. Members of the House serve two-year terms while senators serve six-year terms and are split into three groups, meaning a third of them are up for election every two years. End of Congress\\n\\nDemocrats already have control of the House so they will be looking to keep hold of that while also gaining control of the Senate.\\n\\nIf they had a majority in both chambers they would be able to block or delay President Trump’s plans if he were to be re-elected.\\n\\nAll 435 seats in the House are up for election this year, while 33 Senate seats are also up for grabs.\\n\\nWhen will we find out the result?\\n\\nIt can take several days for every vote to be counted, but it’s usually pretty clear who the winner is by the early hours of the following morning.\\n\\nIn 2016, Donald Trump took to the stage in New York at about 3am to give his victory speech in front of a crowd of jubilant supporters.\\n\\nBut don’t set your alarm clocks just yet. Officials are already warning that we may have to wait longer - possibly days, even weeks - for the result this year because of the expected surge in postal ballots.\\n\\nSkip postal ballots There are two ways to vote in the US - by going to a polling station on election day or by using a postal ballot - but the rules vary depending on which state you are in. All states offer some form of voting by post, but many require you to provide a reason for not being able to vote in person on election day. Some states are accepting the coronavirus as a valid reason to use a postal ballot, but not all of them are at the moment. End of postal ballots\\n\\nThe last time the result wasn’t clear within a few hours was in 2000, when the winner wasn’t confirmed until a Supreme Court ruling was made a month later.\\n\\nSkip a Supreme Court In 2000, the race between Republican candidate George W Bush and Democratic candidate Al Gore was so close that it came down to the result in Florida, where just a few hundred votes separated them. There were weeks of legal battles, which triggered a recount, but eventually the Supreme Court stepped in. Mr Bush was declared the winner, giving him all 25 of Florida’s electoral college votes and leaving him with a winning total of 271 overall. Mr Gore, who won more votes nationally than Mr Bush, conceded defeat. End of a Supreme Court\\n\\nWhen does the winner take office?\\n\\nIf Joe Biden wins the election, he wouldn’t immediately replace President Trump as there is a set transition period to give the new leader time to appoint cabinet ministers and make plans.\\n\\nThe new president is officially sworn into office on 20 January in a ceremony known as the inauguration, which is held on the steps of the Capitol building in Washington DC.\\n\\nAfter the ceremony, the new president makes their way to the White House to begin their four-year term in office.\"},\n",

The ballot counting will continue for a few days yet, but the math is what it is: Joe Biden will have the 270 electoral votes needed to win the White House, and likely many more. President Trump’s four-year assault on our democratic institutions and values will soon end.\\n\\nThe contest generated intense passions. In a year marked by the incalculable loss of life and the economic devastation of a pandemic, Americans turned out to vote in numbers not seen for generations, starting weeks before Election Day. Mr. Trump still knows how to draw a crowd — albeit not always to his advantage. In the end, it was Mr. Biden who captured more votes than any presidential candidate in U.S. history, while Mr. Trump captured the second-most votes in U.S. history.\\n\\nThe tally comes with disappointment on both sides: for Biden supporters, who hoped for a more resounding repudiation of Trumpism and for a Senate ready to enact their agenda, and for Trump supporters, who hoped for another four years and to chasten their critics. Fortunately for America, Mr. Biden promises to be a president for both sides — a welcome shift from a leader who has spent his tenure dividing the electorate into perceived fans and enemies.\\n\\nWhile the coming weeks will most likely bring unexpected moves and more dangerous disinformation from Mr. Trump, it is worth taking this moment to raise a glass and breathe a sigh of relief. America gives its citizenry the ultimate responsibility for holding leaders accountable, for deciding what kind of nation this will be. The broad endorsement of Mr. Biden’s message of unity and healing is cause for celebration. Americans have embraced that optimism and Mr. Biden as their next president.'},\n",

       "  'text': 'In the early years of the Trump administration, with Republicans in control of Congress, the country saw a steady rise in spending and ballooning deficits and debt. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas might not have been quite right when he said that, after all, President Trump “didn’t campaign on cutting the debt.” Actually, Mr. Trump did, but in a throwaway manner, while putting more stress on continued, even increased, big spending and debt.\\n\\nAnd as is so often the case with one-party control, as in Mr. Trump’s first years, big spending took hold. According to the Cato Institute, over Mr. Trump’s four years, spending went up by a total of 10 percent. Something similar happened under George W. Bush: Spending shot up 24 percent.\\n\\nBut what really seems like an effective arrangement for controlling spending is a Democratic president with Republicans in charge of at least one body of Congress. During the first four years of the Barack Obama and Bill Clinton administrations, both of which included years of split control of government, spending was more restrained or even reduced. Under Mr. Clinton, spending inched up only 3 percent. In Mr. Obama’s first term, total spending actually went down by 10 percent.\\n\\nThere are ways beyond the budget that a Biden presidency could be a boon to libertarians. Mr. Trump was a disaster when it came to free trade, kicking off a huge trade war with China and “renegotiating” NAFTA so that it contained more protectionist, anti-free-market measures like wage controls.\\n\\nBy contrast, Mr. Biden will probably cut a more pro-trade profile. Congressional Republicans and Democrats were reluctant to give Mr. Trump trade negotiating authority, but they are more likely to give Mr. Biden that authority than they are to withhold it (despite some pressure from the party’s progressives like Bernie Sanders or Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez).'},\n",

       "  'text': 'Trump May Not Accept The Outcome And 4 Other Takeaways From The 2020 Election\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Andrew Harnik/Pool/Getty Images Andrew Harnik/Pool/Getty Images\\n\\nThe tumultuous and chaotic Trump presidency is coming to an end — even if President Trump himself hasn\\'t accepted it yet.\\n\\nDemocrat Joe Biden is now the president-elect, according to calls from The Associated Press, which NPR relies on for race calls, as well as all the other broadcast networks.\\n\\nLoading...\\n\\nBiden is currently at 290 electoral votes, 20 more than needed thanks to Pennsylvania, which was called Saturday. Biden is on track to win 306 electoral votes if his slim lead holds in Georgia.\\n\\nIt wasn\\'t the timeline many Americans were expecting, given that Election Day was Tuesday, but we warned that counting an unprecedented number of mail-in ballots might take a while — and it\\'s still going. There was record turnout and both Biden and Trump got more votes than any other presidential candidates in history.\\n\\nThere are a lot of lessons from this election, and given the results, governing won\\'t be easy for Biden.\\n\\n1. The popular vote wasn\\'t that close, but Democrats continue to have an electoral map problem\\n\\nGiven how polarized the country is, for Biden to win (as of Sunday night) almost 51% of the popular vote, with a margin of more than 4 million votes and climbing, is a feat.\\n\\nWhen all is said and done, more than 158 million people will have voted this election, according to the U.S. Elections Project, a turnout rate of more than 66%. That would be the highest since 1900. And Biden could get to 80 million votes cast for him, by far the most ever.\\n\\n2020 was a perfect storm for high turnout — a hotly polarizing president up for reelection and the wide use of mail-in voting. States with a history of most- or all-mail elections, like Washington state and Colorado, routinely see turnout of 80% or higher.\\n\\nDemocrats have now won the popular vote in seven of the last eight elections, and yet two of them didn\\'t become president in the past 20 years, and even this year, the margins in key states were very close.\\n\\nDemocrats are concentrated in cities and on the coasts, and that sorting is making presidential elections closer than their advantage with the broader population.\\n\\n2. President Trump still hasn\\'t accepted the outcome — and he may never\\n\\nUnlike every other presidential candidate in the modern TV era, Trump has not made a concession speech, nor has he even called Biden.\\n\\nDemocrat Al Gore retracted his concession in 2000 as the vote got closer between him and Republican George W. Bush, but that was over a 537-vote margin in one state.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\\n\\nThat\\'s not what\\'s happening here. Trump is down more than 10,000 votes in Georgia, more than 20,000 in Wisconsin, more than 30,000 and growing in Nevada, more than 40,000 and climbing in Pennsylvania and 146,000 in Michigan.\\n\\nTrump has filed lawsuits challenging votes in multiple states. And he has requested a recount in Wisconsin. He has every right to go to court and present evidence. If some votes are overturned, that\\'s part of the democratic process. But can he make up differences of tens of thousands of votes in multiple states? Very, very unlikely.\\n\\nAnd part of the role of an American president is to uphold the very thing that separates the United States from corrupt countries — free and fair elections and the peaceful transfer of power.\\n\\nInstead, this president continues to baselessly undermine it with one last conspiracy because it seems he just can\\'t accept losing.\\n\\n3. The suburbs helped Biden to the presidency\\n\\nThe suburbs were a key fight in this presidential election. Trump called for \"law and order\" and tried to win over suburban white women with an anachronistic and outdated view of the suburbs.\\n\\nBiden took a different tack, and it appears he benefited.\\n\\nFor as much as the polls underestimated Trump\\'s support, one thing they continuously showed was that suburban voters were moving away from the president, and that played out in key states.\\n\\nIn the collar counties of Philadelphia, for example, Biden improved on Hillary Clinton\\'s 2016 margin in Chester County by 8 points (so far), and by 5 points in Montgomery and Delaware counties, in addition to other gains he made.\\n\\nIn Georgia, Biden did better than Clinton in Cobb and Gwinnett counties, both outside Atlanta, by double-digits. In Cobb, Clinton won it by 2 points, Biden by 14. In Gwinnett, Clinton won by 6, Biden by 18. These are populous, growing areas that have to worry the GOP.\\n\\n4. Biden rebuilt the \"blue wall,\" but the Sun Belt is the future\\n\\nBiden reversed Trump\\'s 2016 wins in the former \"blue wall\" states of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, but he didn\\'t win by as much as the polls suggested or as past Democrats have.\\n\\nThe three states combined were decided this year by just over 200,000 votes out of more than 15 million — just enough to win.\\n\\nIf those three states don\\'t seem reliably Democratic anymore, that\\'s because they aren\\'t. We\\'re seeing a political realignment in America, most brightly along education lines. Whites without college degrees have migrated away from their lunch-pail Democratic days to Republicans, largely around culture.\\n\\nThe demographics are what they are. All three of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania are majority white noncollege. And that\\'s to say nothing of Iowa and Ohio, which are also majority white noncollege and states Democrats used to be competitive in and don\\'t appear to be anymore.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the South is growing and diversifying, and Biden made important inroads in Georgia, Arizona and even Texas. If Biden holds on to his leads in Arizona and Georgia, he will be the first Democrat to win Arizona since 1996 and the first to win Georgia since 1992. (And in both of those years, Bill Clinton, a Southerner, was at the top of the ticket, and there was a serious third-party contender.)\\n\\nThirty years ago, Georgia was more than 80% white. Today, that is down to 52% and it has seen its share of Northern transplants moving to the Atlanta suburbs.\\n\\nWith continued Latino growth, as well as out-of-state transplants and retirees, Arizona continues its leftward shift. In 2020, Arizona not only voted for Biden in the presidential race, but it will also have two Democratic senators for the first time since the 1950s — and the Democratic Party was very different then.\\n\\nTexas continues to be more of a Democratic hope than reality, but this is the closest Texas has been since 1996. Biden won more than 1.3 million more votes than Clinton in 2016. It wasn\\'t enough, but it\\'s on the map.\\n\\nFlorida, however, is the Sun Belt exception. Republicans have racked up win after win there. Even though it will continue to be close, it seems it\\'s become harder for Democrats to win there.\\n\\n5. Given the down-ballot outcomes, governing is going to prove difficult for Biden\\n\\nDemocrats\\' main goal in 2020 was to get rid of Trump, but they had disappointing performances in House and Senate races.\\n\\nIn the House, Republicans were not expected to make gains, but that\\'s exactly what happened. They currently stand to pick up a net of five seats, when Democrats thought they might expand their majority.\\n\\nThe Senate is still to be decided, hinging on two Georgia races headed to runoffs in January. But key races in Maine, North Carolina, Iowa and Montana that could have clinched full control in Washington didn\\'t go Democrats\\' way.\\n\\nInstead, what\\'s more likely is split control with Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., remaining as majority leader. Biden\\'s skill as a legislator is going to be tested. Today\\'s Senate is not the same Senate he left in 2009; it\\'s far more ideological and polarized. There are some big-ticket items Biden would want to get through, like more coronavirus relief funds, but other items might prove even more difficult.\\n\\nBiden promised a health care public option, a $15 minimum wage and big advancements on climate and racial justice. Those are going to be impossible to get without cooperation from the other side.\\n\\nEven though Biden won the most votes in history, Trump won the second most. Biden called his win a \"mandate,\" but it\\'s hardly that, and politicians often overread mandates.\\n\\nBiden pledged during his campaign to \"unite\" the country, and in his victory speech he said he would reach out to Republicans while delivering for his base.\\n\\nBut how does Biden go about doing that, especially since this is still a hotly divided country that\\'s dealing with a public health crisis, will likely have divided government, and he won\\'t start with the numbers to achieve major legislative accomplishments in his first two years?'},\n",

Trump has not yet conceded to Biden and is preparing to launch several court battles over the election results. Over the weekend, Trump supporters took to the streets in major U.S. cities, chanting “stop the steal” — a rallying cry behind unfounded assertions that widespread election fraud led to Biden winning enough electoral college votes to be deemed the legitimate winner.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHelme, a key member of the populist Estonian Conservative People’s Party (EKRE), reportedly also said that Biden and his son Hunter are “corrupt characters” and that Trump “will win eventually. It will happen as a result of an immense struggle, maybe even bloodshed but justice will win in the end.”\\n\\nHe also described a dream in which he saw Trump walking through a field of “guts and entrails,” Estonia’s public broadcaster reported.\\n\\nHelme’s son, Martin, who leads the EKRE and serves as finance minister, was also interviewed on the program. He claimed that “there is no question that these elections were falsified,” the Associated Press reported, citing Estonian media.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“I believe all normal people should speak up against it,” he said. “There is no point in talking about democracy or rule of law in a situation where elections can be faked so plainly, boldly and on a massive scale.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe elder Helme announced Monday that he decided to resign after seeing “the slander and lies produced by the Estonian media.”\\n\\nHe told the country’s public broadcaster that he is “tired.”\\n\\n“I did nothing yesterday that would endanger Estonia’s security,” he said. “I have not said anything that has not already been told by the American media, the American free media.”\\n\\nThe younger Helme remains in his post.\\n\\nTop Estonian politicians condemned the comments, with President Kersti Kaljulaid saying she was “sad and embarrassed.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn a statement Sunday, Estonian Prime Minister Juri Ratas defended the transparency of the U.S. election process and called on the father and son to “immediately stop undermining Estonian-U.S. relations.”\\n\\n“Crude criticism of these processes based on spurious information and fake news is not appropriate for ministers of the Republic of Estonia,” he said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nRatas described the United States as “an important ally, and indispensable strategic partner, both for Estonia and the European Union” and said a strong relationship between the two countries is key for strategic defense.\\n\\n“Aggressive rhetoric directed against one of our most important allies is therefore extremely irresponsible,” he said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nEstonian Defense Minister Juri Luik also condemned the comments, saying they “threaten to deteriorate U.S.-Estonian relations” and “are dangerous to the security of all of us, including that of their own supporters.”\\n\\nTrump has taken an ambivalent approach to NATO, which Estonia relies on as a bulwark against neighboring Russia.\\n\\n“We are a country of 1 million people on the border of Russia,” Luik said in a statement. “Taking into account the Estonian geopolitical situation, our relationship with the U.S. is of existential importance.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn Germany, Beatrix von Storch, a deputy leader with the Alternative for Germany party, also echoed Trump’s accusations of voter fraud. “I share the view that there are discernible irregularities,” she said in an interview with German public radio Thursday. “It’s stunning when all of a sudden 100 percent of all late-counted mail-in ballots are for Biden and zero for Trump.”\\n\\nOn Saturday, von Storch tweeted that “it is far from certain who has won … And that is a good thing: a democratic constitutional state would be well advised to dispel accusations of massive indications of voter fraud.”'},\n",

That’s our main hope and objective,” said Ihor Novikov, a former adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, whose July 2019 phone call with Trump helped launch the impeachment inquiries over Trump’s “do us a favor” request for Ukraine to reopen corruption probes involving Hunter Biden.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“Everyone here in Kyiv is glad that this election cycle is coming to a close,” Novikov added.\\n\\nAs the U.S. vote count unfolded, Kyiv officials kept with their practice of eschewing any action that may be interpreted as taking a side.\\n\\nUkraine’s ambassador to Washington, Volodymyr Yelchenko, spoke to a Ukrainian news outlet in which he praised the Trump administration for providing Ukraine with “real military, lethal, strategic aid” in the battle against pro-Moscow separatists in eastern Ukraine. Yelchenko also underscored that support for his country has been a bipartisan issue.\\n\\nStill, during the past four years, it has often been a struggle for Ukraine to steer clear of the political skirmishes between Democrats and Republicans.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe Trump-Zelensky call became the center of a whistleblower report that was pored over during Trump’s impeachment.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAt the same time, Republicans pushed unsupported accusations that Joe Biden, while he was vice president, engineered the firing of a Ukrainian chief prosecutor to squelch an investigation into a Ukrainian energy company, Burisma, for which his son Hunter sat on the board.\\n\\nGiuliani and his associates traveled to Ukraine in an attempt to dig up dirt on the Bidens — during which they received information from a Ukrainian lawmaker, Andriy Derkach, whom U.S. officials have identified as a Russian agent.\\n\\nNow, says Kyiv political analyst Yevhen Hlibovytsky, Ukrainians hope they can put this behind them and focus on “international” issues.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“Biden’s win brings back some certainty to the U.S. vision of NATO and other international organizations,” Hlibovytsky said. This will make Ukraine’s ability to set its security priorities “more manageable,” he added.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut Ukraine’s primary goals remain the same: support in the war in eastern Ukraine, financial assistance to its struggling economy and help in its attempts to tackle corruption and introduce needed reforms.\\n\\nThe Biden presidency could be a major boost.

Biden said during the campaign that Russia is America’s main security threat.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“[He] understands the geopolitical importance of Ukraine in pushing back Russian malign activity,” Ash said.\\n\\nAt the very least, Ukrainians hope for an end to the mixed signals coming from the United States concerning Russia and its president, Vladimir Putin.'},\n",

Russia has repeatedly denied that.\\n\\n“It seems that there is already one loser in the presidential race — that is the procedure itself and, ultimately, democracy,” Konstantin Kosachev, head of the foreign affairs committee in the upper house of the Russian parliament, wrote on Facebook.\\n\\n“However, withdrawal from the main agenda the issue of ‘Russian meddling’ may prove to be, if not a positive, at least a stabilizing factor, and it will no longer be used by opponents in domestic political squabbles,” Kosachev added.\\n\\n\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWith Biden, Russia will not need a learning curve as with Trump. During his eight years as vice president, Biden held policy meetings with NATO leaders and conducted face-to-face talks with Putin as part of the Obama administration’s attempt to “reset” relations.\\n\\nFour years ago, Putin congratulated Trump within hours of his acceptance speech. Asked what would make Biden’s projected victory official in the Kremlin’s view, Peskov declined to comment.\\n\\n“In any case, we hope that with the next president of the U.S., we will manage to establish a dialogue and together agree on ways to normalize our bilateral relations,” Peskov said.\\n\\nPutin appeared to be hedging for the possibility of a Biden presidency in the weeks leading up to the U.S. elections. In an interview with Russian state television in late October, Putin said he didn’t “see anything criminal” about Hunter Biden’s past business ties in Russia or Ukraine, pouring cold water on a popular attack line from the Trump camp about Biden’s son.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAlexander Gabuev, an analyst at the Carnegie Moscow Center, wrote on Twitter that “a president who is not tainted by suspicion of being a Russian asset — and who knows how to organize a normal bureaucratic process for national security discussions — will be able to restore some guardrails” to the countries’ relations.\\n\\nAmong the top priorities for Russia is an extension of New START, a 10-year accord that places limits on the two countries’ nuclear warheads. If the 2010 treaty, which expires in February, is not extended or replaced, the world’s two biggest nuclear powers will return to an era without substantive restraints on their arsenals for the first time in decades.\\n\\nPutin has said he would agree to a clause in the current treaty that allows the leaders of both nations to extend the agreement by five years without requiring ratification, and in an interview with state television last month, he said Biden’s willingness to do the same “is a serious signal for our possible future interaction.”\\n\\nBut Moscow sees downsides to a Biden presidency, including his expected re-engagement with NATO. Biden also has signaled harsher measures, perhaps in the form of more sanctions, for Russia’s interference in Western democracies. In an interview with “60 Minutes” before the election, Biden pointed to Russia as “the biggest threat to America right now in terms of breaking up our security and our alliances.”\\n\\nRussian lawmaker Dmitry Novikov told Russia’s Interfax news agency Wednesday that “it is clear that, situationally, Trump is better for us,” adding that Trump isolated America from its European allies and worsened relations with China.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“All these points of tension which Trump created for the U.S. give us certain possibilities,” Novikov said.\\n\\nAnother member of Russia’s State Duma, Leonid Slutsky, wrote on Facebook that “no changes for the better can be expected” regardless of which candidate proved victorious.\\n\\nIn Russian state media, coverage focused more on the split vote and predictions that America’s political fissures will continue to preoccupy the country and erode its global standing. Trump’s premature declaration of victory early Wednesday became a punching bag for Russian commentators.\\n\\nOne op-ed from pro-Kremlin newspaper Moskovsky Komsomolets said, “The word \\'democracy\\' has been becoming less and less applicable to the United States. At the helm of the American state is the man who talks openly about his intention to retain the presidential post despite voters\\' expressed will.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut some Russians expressed admiration for a competitive presidential election, something Moscow hasn’t had under Putin for the past 20 years.

       "  'text': \"There’s more evidence of voter fraud in the 2020 election than there ever was of Russia collusion, so America is owed a legal examination of the election irregularities alleged by the Trump campaign.\\n\\nIt’s not crazy to say this, despite the gaslighting from much of the media.\\n\\nBasically, the election is down to roughly 120,000 votes of almost 150 million votes cast.\\n\\nThat’s 0.08 percent, a tiny margin by anyone’s reckoning.\\n\\nLIZ PEEK: BIDEN THE UNITER? HERE'S WHY I DON'T THINK IT WILL HAPPEN\\n\\nRecounts have been ordered. President Trump’s campaign is challenging hundreds of thousands of votes in the courts.\\n\\nFive swing states are within 1 percent, all with Joe Biden in the lead.\\n\\nIn Georgia, Biden was ahead on Sunday night by just 10,352 votes.\\n\\nIn Arizona, he was ahead by 19,438 votes.\\n\\nIn Wisconsin, he was ahead by 20,540.\\n\\nIn Pennsylvania, he was ahead by 43,251.\\n\\nIn Nevada, he was ahead by 31,464.\\n\\nIt is not outlandish or unprecedented to accept the possibility that at least some of those margins may be erroneous, whether through human error or, indeed, fraud.\\n\\nElectoral fraud is not unknown in America. Probably the most famous example was in 1960, when Chicago Mayor Richard Daley allegedly rigged the ballot for John F. Kennedy, dead people were found to have “voted” and 677 election officials were indicted.\\n\\nDue to the pandemic, around 40 percent of votes in Tuesday’s election were cast by mail, double the percentage in 2016.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\\n\\nEven the New York Times once reported the truth that mail-in voting is the most vulnerable to fraud.\\n\\nThis is why most developed countries ban the practice.\\n\\nSo, as you can see, it is perfectly reasonable in such a close election to take seriously allegations of irregularities and suspicious activity.\\n\\nAn honest media would investigate rather than dismissing the allegations out of hand as “baseless,” “false” and “conspiracy theories.”\\n\\nThe Trump campaign’s legal team, led by former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, claims that, in Pennsylvania alone, 600,000 ballots are in question because they were counted without any poll-watchers observing to ensure they were legitimate, as state law requires.\\n\\nIn Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, Giuliani says that “50 to 60 poll-watchers … will all testify that they were uniformly deprived of their right to inspect any single part of the mail-in ballots … Not a single one was inspected as the law required. Even when a court order was obtained to allow the Republican inspectors to get six feet closer, they moved the people counting the ballots six further feet away.\\n\\n“It’s really simple. If you have nothing to hide with these mail-in ballots, you allow inspection.”\\n\\nGiuliani has promised one lawsuit will be filed today and four more by the end of this week.\\n\\nAnother Trump team lawyer, Sidney Powell, claimed yesterday that 450,000 ballots had been found with only votes for Biden and no down-ballot selections, which she regarded as suspicious.\\n\\nShe also claimed in an interview on Fox News that two pieces of software called Hammer and Scorecard were used to flip votes from Trump to Biden in some pre-election voting ballots.\\n\\nAs well, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger announced Saturday an “issue involving reporting” of votes in Fulton County on Friday, and said he had sent “investigators onsite.”\\n\\nSen. Lindsey Graham, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said in a statement that he will be investigating “all credible allegations of voting irregularities and misconduct” after receiving a sworn affidavit from Pennsylvania postal worker Richard Hopkins alleging that Erie Postmaster Robert Weisenbach had told workers he was “back-dating the postmarks on the ballots to make it appear as though the ballots had been collected on November 3, 2020 despite them in fact being collected on November 4 and possibly later.”\\n\\nGraham, R-S.C., also yesterday claimed that in Pennsylvania, the Trump team has found “over 100 people they think were dead but 15 people that we verified that have been dead who voted … Six people registered after they died and voted.”\\n\\nAll of this may not amount to a hill of beans. But it deserves to be examined, or otherwise 71 million people who voted for Trump may end up believing the election was stolen.\\n\\n“This is no longer about any single election,” Trump said in a statement over the weekend, calling for full transparency in vote counting and election certification.\\n\\n“This is about the integrity of our entire election process.”\\n\\nQuite right.\\n\\nWhatever comes of the allegations, in reality, nothing is more important than two Georgia US Senate runoffs, on which control of the Senate may depend.\\n\\nSince neither of the Republicans, David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, has reached the 50 percent threshold in votes required under Georgia law to win outright, there has to be a redo on Jan. 5.\\n\\nIf they both were to lose, the US Senate would be deadlocked 50-50, with the vice president, Kamala Harris, having the deciding vote. In other words, the Democrats would be in control and nothing would impede their radical agenda, including the Green New Deal, packing the Supreme Court and adding two new states.\\n\\nIn the end, it’s worth remembering that the situation we are in today is not unprecedented.\\n\\nIt took 37 days for the legal battles to be sorted out after the very close 2000 election, and George W. Bush to be declared the winner.\\n\\nSo why the unseemly rush now for Biden to declare victory, as he did in one of his weird car park appearances Saturday night?\\n\\nHis son Hunter Biden, currently under FBI investigation, was on stage, fully clothed and minus the crack pipe, which was nice.\\n\\nOf course, Trump’s team will have to provide concrete evidence of systemic fraud enough to flip the election result in enough states to make a difference to the outcome.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nIt’s a very high bar, so I wouldn’t be holding my breath.\\n\\nBut it’s 2020. Stranger things have happened.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM MIRANDA DEVINE\"},\n",

Broadcaster Russia Today — labeled by American authorities as an international outlet for Russian propaganda — has at times portrayed the election as circus-like.\\n\\n\"It seems ridiculous that such a great country, the biggest democracy in the world, that their democracy is so weird and their system is so strange that it brings to the top people like these,\" said Russia Today\\'s Editor-In-Chief Margarita Simonyan, who described President Trump as \"a little off\" and said Biden \"sometimes seems to be in dementia.\"\\n\\nShe predicted that \"chaos and riots\" would be \"absolutely inevitable\" in the aftermath of the election.\\n\\nMaria Lipman says political uncertainty in the U.S. serves Russia\\'s interest.\\n\\n\"If you have a powerful enemy and the enemy is in a state of crisis and chaos, you can benefit by that,\" she told CBS News.\\n\\nZakharova, the Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, said Thursday that Russia would continue \"closely monitoring\" the vote counting in the U.S., adding: \"We hope the available legal mechanisms will be sufficient to determine the future head of state in accordance with the Constitution and, most importantly, to avoid public unrest.\"'}]"
